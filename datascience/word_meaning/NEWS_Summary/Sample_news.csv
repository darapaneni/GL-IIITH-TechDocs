"New York police are concerned drones could become tools for terrorists, and are investigating ways to stop potential attacks. Until now police haven't acknowledged drones as a potential weapon, but the NYPD has now said the technology has advanced enough that someone could use them to carry out an air assault using chemical weapons and firearms. Police want to develop technology which will allow them to take control of drones as well as scan the skies for them before major events. The NYPD says drones carrying explosives are the number one threat as they investigate ways to stop attacks . Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace, left, was concerned about an incident last year where a drone was landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 'could have took the chancellor and her people out' A drone which was flown over a packed football stadium in Manchester, England, just over a week ago, resulting in the suspected pilot being arrested . They are consulting with the military and members of its counterterrorism, bomb squad, emergency services and aviation units are working on a plan to counter weaponized drones. The NYPD hasn't received any intelligence indicating there is an imminent threat, but has become increasingly concerned over the last year. Deputy Chief Salvatore DiPace told CBS News: 'We've looked at some people that have jury-rigged these drones to carry guns, to carry different types of explosives if they wanted to; there's just so many possibilities that we're very worried about.' Mr Dipace said police had also seen video showing how accurate an attack from a drone could be: 'We've seen some video where the drone was flying at different targets along the route and very accurately hitting the targets with the paintball. The NYPD now sees a drone carrying explosives as the number one threat. Mr DiPace's concerns follow an incident in Germany last year where a drone was able to land just in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she delivered a speech. The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech sin Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act . He said: 'If you really think about what could have happened there, the drone hit its target right on the mark and could have took the chancellor and her people out.' There has been a dramatic increase of incidents involving drones in New York City in the last year, with 40 recorded. In some cases unmanned aircraft systems or drones had flown into airspace being used by NYPD helicopters. In one incident this summer, a drone which was almost 800 feet off the ground, nearly collided with a police helicopter. NYPD Aviation Unit Member, Sergeant Antonio Hernandez said: 'We're flying in the dark; we have night-vision goggles on, we're trying to get a job done and then the next thing you know we see this drone come up to our altitude.'","Police have investigated criminals who have rigged guns to drones .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Perhaps Australian porn star Angela White thought she was bringing the ultimate steamy study fantasy to life when she and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne. The video is believed to have been shot this year, while the library was open for use and has sparked outrage from the university and the ire of police. Despite the presence of nearby students, White starts the video by revealing herself between bookshelves, as reported by the Herald Sun. Raunchy: Angela White and a partner secretly filmed sex acts in the library of La Trobe University in Melbourne . White and her onscreen lover then move to nearby desks, with her partner keeping lookout. A La Trobe University spokesman said it was shocked and appalled by the 'brazen act'. 'We knew nothing about the video footage until we were recently informed by some of our students.'Permission was not sought, nor would it have been given. If requested we would assist fully with any police investigation.' A Victoria Police spokeswoman said if the pair were caught in the act, they could have faced charges including wilful and obscene exposure. 'Brazen act': La Trobe was unaware of the video had been filmed and was left outraged by the embarrassment . On the back of the controversy, Whiteâ€™s Dutch-based production company AGW Entertainment issued a statement addressing the incident and has since removed the video, which had been published online. 'AGW Entertainment B.V. regrets that the filming and/or posting of the video in question may have offended members of the public,â€ .","Porn star Angela White secretly filmed sex acts with a partner in a university library .

"This was, Sergio Garcia conceded, much like being hunted by Tiger, complete with the roars that  provided the first sign of danger. Only this time here it was Rory McIlroy who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him. McIlroy who was drawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind. For Garcia and Rickie Fowler, it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in Hoylake all the more torturous. As Fowler dropped a shot on 17, his third bogey in four holes, McIlroy could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th. Under pressure: Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler during the third round on Saturday . As the American and the Spaniard then made their way across the third fairway to the scorer's tent, there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the Ulsterman. Fowler had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between first and second widening. Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day's first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group off. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there. It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who came through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an almost futile exercise however well those in  the chasing pack might be playing. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you can do is say ""well done"".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32  and then birdying 10, 11 and 12  to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had taken into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, because he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating McIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not to  mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel the force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The advice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun being around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him and  seeing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with Butch  Harmon – a coach Fowler described as the 'best in the world' – the young American has been  itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too,  sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if he will want to  forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia thinks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to shoot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's difficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits him. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American Rickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having grown up competing against  McIlroy. They are just a few months apart in age – now both 25 – and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in Jupiter, Florida. They also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if McIlroy joked this week that  Fowler's fashion sense – he will once again wear the orange of Olklahoma State University today – was highly questionable. 'We've travelled a bit together between tournaments,' said Fowler. 'We first played against each other at the Walker Cup in 2007 and it's kind of gone from there. So I'm  looking forward to it tomorrow. It's going to be a good time. We're good buddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as possible. 'If I can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a bit, get myself in the mix, maybe we'll be able to throw some blows back and forth. 'The US Open last month was my first time in the final group at a major. But it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a final group together.'","American draws inspiration from fellow countryman in Open bid .

"An Ebola outbreak that began in Guinea four months ago has turned into a cross-border African crisis that could spread to more countries, the World Health Organisation warned last night. Despite efforts by health authorities and aid groups to contain its spread, the WHO has recorded 635 infections, including 399 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since the outbreak started. The crisis is already the deadliest outbreak since Ebola first emerged in central Africa in 1976, and the number of infections continues to rise. The WHO is calling for drastic action to halt the epidemic. Scroll down for video .

Mr Sambo said: ‘There is an urgent need to intensify response efforts; to promote cross-border collaboration and information sharing of suspected cases and contacts... and to mobilise all sectors of the community. 'This is the only way that the outbreak will be effectively addressed.’ Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said this week that a lack of understanding has meant people continue to prepare corpses and attend funerals of victims, leaving them vulnerable to a disease transmitted by touching victims or via bodily fluids. MSF accused civil society groups, governments and religious authorities of failing to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic, resulting in few prominent figures promoting the fight against the disease.","World Health Organisation: 635 infections and 399 deaths since outbreak .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 14 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 14 November 2013 . Residents of several Florida homes have been evacuated due to a sinkhole that opened up in a Dunedin, Florida backyard, near St Petersburg Thursday. Dunedin Deputy Fire Chief Trip Barrs said the hole appeared to be about 12-feet wide when officials arrived on the scene around 6am, but grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep by 9am. Residents of seven neighboring houses were evacuated as a precaution and power has been shut off in the area. No injuries have been reported. Scroll down for video . Into the earth: A sinkhole opened up this morning in Dunedin, Florida, swallowing up parts of two homes . Expanding: When fire and rescue responders arrived on the scene around 6am, the sinkhole was 12-feet-wide but soon grew to 40-feet-wide and 30-feet-deep . Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole . Homeowner Michael Dupre said they heard the sinkhole open up in their backyard around 5:15 this morning. 'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' his daughter Ivy Dupre told Fox 13. Ivy Dupre said that there seemed to be two sinkholes, one that opened up in the backyard and one near her bedroom, but that has not yet been confirmed by fire and rescue officials. The sinkhole has swallowed up the master bedroom and in-ground pool of one home, while another home lost their deck and boat. After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground. Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole. On February 28, Jeffrey Bush died when a sinkhole opened under his bedroom in Seffner, Florida, near Tampa. His body was never recovered. In August, sections of a building at a resort near Orlando collapsed into a sinkhole. No one was injured in that sinkhole. Early morning surprise: According to homeowners in the area, the sinkhole opened up at about 5:15 this morning . 'After the Seffner sinkhole, we were scared,' Mr Dupre told WTSP. 'We've been dealing with our insurance company and finally two days ago, they started working on our house. Now it looks like our house is gone.' State officials say three counties in the Tampa region are known as 'sinkhole alley.' Two-thirds of the sinkhole damage claims reported to the state Office of Insurance Regulation between 2006 and 2010 came from Hernando, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Dunedin is in neighboring Pinellas County.","A sinkhole opened up at 5:15am this morning in Dunedin, Florida near St Petersburg .

"Jerusalem woke up on Tuesday to horrific images of slain Jewish worshipers, and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue. The assault which took place in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof, shocked Israel to the core, as well as many others around the world. This is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place, where innocent religious people were worshiping. The two assailants, cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, were shot dead by the Israeli security forces. The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer, left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time. The attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down, further escalation and worse violence is around the corner. Regrettably, the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the ""Battle for Jerusalem."" He also accused the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of involvement despite the latter's condemnation of the killing. Both sides are employing inflammable language, although it is hard to blame the Palestinian president for feeling angry considering Israeli behavior since the collapse of the peace process in April. To make things worse, it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists' families, even if they were killed during the attack. The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants. Regardless of the fate they face, their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless. In a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof, one act harms quite a few people, from babies to the elderly.  To prove the seriousness of their intentions, the Israeli security forces already demolished a home on Wednesday. The home in Silwan was that of the Palestinian who drove his car into a crowd last month, killing two people. He was killed in the attack. The Army also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in Jerusalem. Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army.  A report produced, following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment, found this action counter-productive. There is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks. House demolition of Palestinian militants' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge, concealed behind a claim of deterrence. A similar ""standard"" was never applied to a Jewish terrorist. For instance when a  Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, slayed 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of Patriarchs, no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem, in the height of the Second Intifada, between 2001-2005, 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence. There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security. It is worth remembering that the demolition of Palestinian houses in the West Bank also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements, something which aggravates an already hostile population. Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy, but are also illegal and immoral. This is a clear violation of international law, more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention, clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory. Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge. And there is also, of course, a moral aspect. As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals, their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides. Their families, as a result, suffered a loss too, for no fault of their own. To condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty. The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one, aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition. The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands. However, the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument, combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice.","Two Palestinians carried out a deadly attack on a Jerusalem synagogue this week .

"An Australian father who is believed to have been brainwashed by the preachings of Islamic extremist Musa Cerantonio has joined the ranks of terror group Islamic State to fight in the Middle East. According to Twitter, Zia Abdul Haq's current location is in an IS-controlled area of Ash-Shaam, also known as Syria. Friends of the 33-year-old believed the man from Logan - south of Brisbane - was moving to Syria to look for a new wife after the breakdown of his marriage, but The Courier Mail has revealed Abdul Haq is in fact fighting with the extremist organisation. Scroll down for video . The friends of Zia Abdul Haq says the father-of-one, from Logan, is a 'good-hearted guy' Two of Australia's most notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar are part of the same group. Abdul Haq is one of the latest of three men who are believed to have joined IS, including Melbourne's Abu Khaled al-Cambodi and Mounir Raad. The 33-year-old's friends described him as a 'good-hearted guy' but had been 'brainwashed' by Cerantonio - who is believed to be an influential IS figure - after hearing the radical sheik speak in Brisbane two years ago. The 33-year-old's friends claim he was brainwashed by prominent IS supporter, Musa Cerantonio - a radical sheik . 'He wasn’t a bad guy but he fell off the rails and under the spell of the extremists,' friend Yehya El-Kholed told The Courier Mail. 'Sheik Cerantonio is a hypocrite because while he urges people to go to Syria, he won’t go himself.' Since he landed in Syria, Abdul Haq - who came to Australia in his 20s and took up a job as a finance officer - has been actively posting photos depicting life as a fighter for IS on the social media site. These include M16 training, jihadists playing violent video games and cooking up a shared meal. But like Sharrouf and Elomar, Abdul Haq - who has a young son - has used Twitter as platform to fire off threatening messages, including one to foreign forces to 'bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers'. Most recently, he took aim at the U.S. saying 'Send you (men) to fight us, your drones are useless on the ground'  and 'How come you fight #IS with your gays & lesbians army' on Saturday night. Abdul Haq has also hit back at media outlets circulating news about him. 'Many lies about me in Australian news. =/,' he tweeted within half an hour of reports emerging. Since arriving in Syria Abdul Haq has been posting photos on Twitter of what it is like being an IS fighter . Last month Musa Cerantonio was deported back to Australia from the Philippines after he was arrested after breaching the Philippines' immigration laws. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before his arrest. He was found with a Filipino fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. He was then set free when he arrived in Melbourne after deportation as he had not broken any Australian laws. Musa Cerantonio is thought to be an influential IS figure and Abdul Haq is believed to have taken up extremist views after hearing the sheik speak in 2012 in Brisbane .","Zia Abdul Haq is believed to be fighting in Syria for the terror group .

"A mother whose premature twins died while she lay in a coma following a tragic ambulance mix-up has led the tributes among mourners at her daughters' funeral. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham yesterday in a wheelchair. She was allowed out of hospital especially for the service, which comes after she spent 18 days in a coma only to be told upon regaining consciousness that her daughters had passed away. Scroll down for video . Jocelyn Bennett, 27, attended the service for her children Melody and Rose Clarke at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham in a wheelchair. She was supported by friends and family at the service for her twin daughters . The white horse-drawn princess carriage carried the coffins to the service at Lodge Hill Crematorium . Pink bunting was draped over the coffins of the twin daughters, with their names Melody and Rose on . The twin girls, Melody and Rose Clarke (pictured above in images released by the family), died from multi-organ failure on November 4 . Wearing her favourite colour red, she was wheeled behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage. White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes. A card showing a picture of Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin, 31, cradling their tragic twins simply read: 'God Bless you Melody and Rose.' Reverend Denise Jones, who led the service, paid tribute to Melody and Rose saying they were two 'very very special baby girls'. She told the 50-strong congregation: 'They were much loved and wanted twin girls and baby sisters to little Slater. 'The last few weeks have been a journey of great courage, determination and faith. The loss of our children is the most painful thing to ever have to experience in our lives. 'Melody and Rose touched the hearts of all of us here today as well as the community and world and they have left behind a beautiful legacy of love.' Hymns 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' and 'Lord of the Dance' were sang by the congregation who all dressed in bright colours on the request of Ms Bennett. Mourners were played 'Somewhere over the rainbow' at the end of the 40-minute ceremony. The babies were delivered by emergency caesarean while Ms Bennett fought for life after collapsing at her home in Druids Heath, Birmingham. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she called 999 early in the morning of October 29 after suffering suffered a placental abruption. When paramedics arrived 12 minutes later at 5.51am, she was in such pain that she could not press the door buzzer to let them in.

Tragically, her neighbours refused to buzz the ambulance crew into the council-run tower block because they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the flats. When police finally arrived to let the paramedics in, they found Ms Bennett lying unconscious on the floor of flat - 30 minutes after her initial 999 call. She was rushed to hospital where 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose were born by emergency caesarean. Tragically, while Ms Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered multi-organ failure and their life support was switched off. They passed away on November 4. The devastated father of Ms Bennett, Joe, 54, said yesterday: 'This has been a tragic time for Jocelyn and everybody in the family. 'We are grateful for all the support and glad Jocelyn was able to attend the service. 'There are still questions which need answering as to why the paramedics were unable to get to Jocelyn sooner but today is about saying goodbye to Rose and Melody.' Following their deaths, Mr Bennett wrote a poem for each of the girls. He previously told how neighbours in the block of flats refused to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. 'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.' Birmingham City Council is investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.' Tributes placed with the coffins from relatives of Ms Bennett offered condolences and love to the family . Rose and Melody were born prematurely and died aged just a few days old due to severe organ failure . The twins' tiny coffins arrived by a horse-drawn princess carriage before floral tributes were placed outside . Prior to their deaths, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened. Ms Bennett's father, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Mr Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins. Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma. She came round on November 16. At the time of the party, Mr Bennett said: 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives. 'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. On the day they passed away, the hospital chaplain performed a touching service before the babies were placed in their father's arms for one last cuddle. Mr Bennett and his family held the babies and celebrated an early Christmas with them before their deaths .

"A community stalwart with an MBE has been spared jail after claiming more than £23,000 of taxpayers' money by lying about his savings. Former magistrate Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years - despite, at one point, having more than £102,000 across nine bank accounts. But the retired charity director, who was also a local councillor in Pendle, Lancashire, was yesterday spared jail for his crimes. Guilty: Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, was yesterday spared jail for falsely claiming more than £23,000 in benefits. The former magistrate and local councillor was awarded an MBE in 2005 . Speaking after the hearing, Raja, originally from Gujarat, Pakistan, said: 'I am very sorry. I made a mistake.' Raja, who has already paid the amounts . back in full, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. He pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly failing to . disclose information to make a gain for self, and one count of . dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit. Preston Magistrates' Court heard that, between October 2003 and September 2013, Raja told the Department for Work and Pensions he was retired and had just £5,601 in savings. He wrongly claimed £11,379 in the process. Dishonest: The retired charity director received pension credits and council tax reductions for 10 years . Raja also failed to declare his real savings to Pendle Council in November 2004, allowing him to wrongly claim £11,898 between October 2003 and March 2013. John Abbott, prosecuting, told the court how Raja would receive the payments into his Halifax bank account via automatic credit transfer. He said: 'Evidence has now become available that he had £83,000 on October 6, 2003 which was not disclosed at the time. Had the true facts been known, there would have been an effect on his benefits.' In 2009, Raja claimed he only had one bank account, which he shared with his wife. But Mr Abbott said: 'He had nine other accounts in his and his wife’s names and agrees they were there when he made the original claims for pension credit. He denied acting dishonestly and said he made a mistake.' John Wishart, defending, said: 'First of all, the guidelines make it clear that a large sum of money can be accumulated over a long period of time, as in this case. 'Of considerable mitigation is that the money was instantly repaid in full. The final payment was made in September last year.' He added that the ‘highest recorded amount’ in Raja’s savings at any one time was ‘a little over £102,000’. He added that although these accounts were in his name, they were shared by many members of Raja’s family. Sparing Raja jail, chairman of the bench Kathleen Strickland said his offences had been aggravated because he 'committed the fraud from the outset’. But she said Raja’s age, early guilty plea, full repayment and ill health prevented her from handing out an immediate custodial sentence. As well as his suspended jail sentence, which could be activated it he re-offends within 12 months, Raja must pay court costs of £85 and a £75 victim surcharge. Mrs Strickland said: “If you break this condition it could be very serious for you.” Spared jail: Raja, the former director of a community development trust, was handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Preston Magistrates' Court . Raja was chosen to receive an MBE through his work as a former director of the Ithaad Community Development Trust in Nelson, which provided help and advice to those who needed it. Speaking after the case, he said: “I am very sorry. I made a mistake. All along I have said it’s my family’s money and my children’s money. “I filled out the forms but I did them wrong. My memory is not good and I am sorry.”","Rahmat Ali Raja, 75, dishonestly claimed benefits for 10 years .

"(CNN) -- Congress has moved to prevent money from the proposed $825 billion stimulus package from being used for zoos, aquariums, golf courses, swimming pools and casinos, an effort to ensure the bill funds only what it calls the ""highest quality"" infrastructure projects. Restrictions added to the stimulus proposal would keep the money from zoo projects, among other things. ""The purpose of this bill is to direct funding at projects that are primarily and clearly aimed at benefiting the economic conditions of communities and the public at large,"" the bill states. ""The federal government and all other levels of government are directed to look with a skeptical eye at projects that don't meet that test."" CNN revealed last month that a list of ""ready to go"" stimulus projects endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors included museum and zoo renovations, aquatic centers, skateboard parks and bike and horse paths. One of the zoo projects in the report is a $4.8 million polar bear exhibit at the Providence, Rhode Island, zoo. The House Appropriations Committee added those restrictions last week after criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union, which monitors government spending. ""To the people supporting them, these proposals aren't a joke,"" said Pete Sepp, the group's vice president. ""But to the taxpayers funding them, yes this will be a joke for them, only they won't be laughing."" The restrictions in the bill appear meant to address reports about some of the projects endorsed by the U.S. mayors, Sepp said. The stimulus bill, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, has been placed on the congressional fast-track. It could come to a vote in the full House of Representatives as soon as Wednesday, and Democratic leaders have said they aim to get the package to President Obama's desk for enactment by Presidents Day.  Watch Obama say he's optimistic after discussing the bill with GOP leaders » . ""A historical level of transparency, oversight and accountability will help guarantee taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and Americans can see results for their investment,"" Rep. Dave Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who leads the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. The committee also added language that would prevent any money given to the state of Illinois from being handled by the state's impeached governor, Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich faces federal charges accusing him of attempting to trade or sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Obama after his November election, and the state Senate began his trial Monday. The governor denies any wrongdoing and has skipped his impeachment trial to proclaim his innocence on the talk-show circuit. The measure sets up project monitoring, including a government-wide recovery program Web site, where all announcements for grant competitions, formula grant allocations and competitive grant awards must be listed. In addition, government agencies must publish on the site, ""a description of all infrastructure projects, and the total cost and the justification for using stimulus money."" The strict rules require that the notification include ""the name of a person to contact at the entity if there are concerns with the investment and an e-mail address for the federal official in each agency whom the public can contact,"" the bill states. ""Also included within the notification must be a certification from the mayor or governor or other chief executive, as appropriate, that the investment has received the full review and vetting required by law and that they accept responsibility that this investment is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars."" A Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board will be created ""to review management of recovery dollars and provide early earning of problems,"" according to a summary of the bill provided by the appropriations committee. The board will include inspectors general and deputy cabinet secretaries. The stimulus package is already being taken up by key committees in the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid -- from casino-heavy Nevada -- said he is not concerned about the House restrictions on money going to casinos. ""Casinos are a huge part of Nevada's economy and create a lot of jobs,"" Reid told CNN on Tuesday. ""But none of the spending in this bill is earmarked for any casino, so this provision is largely symbolic.""","House panel adds restrictions to stimulus bill after criticism from watchdog groups .

"(CNN) -- He was loved and admired the world over, profiled in books and movies, and showered with awards and accolades. But even the most public of personalities have little-known facts buried in their biographies. Here are 10 surprising facts you probably didn't know about Nelson Mandela: . 1. He lived up to his name: Mandela's birth name was Rolihlahla. In his Xhosa tribe, the name means pulling the branch of a tree or troublemaker. (The name ""Nelson"" was given to him by his teacher on his first day of elementary school. It's not clear why she chose that particular name. It was the 1920s, and African children were given English names so colonial masters could pronounce them easily). 2. He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film: He had a big part in Spike Lee's 1992 biopic ""Malcolm X."" At the very end of the movie, he plays a teacher reciting Malcolm X's famous speech to a room full of Soweto school kids. But the pacifist Mandela wouldn't say ""by any means necessary."" So Lee cut back to footage of Malcolm X to close out the film. 3. There's a woodpecker named after him: From Cape Town to California, streets named after Mandela abound. But he's also been the subject of some rather unusual tributes. Last year, scientists named a prehistoric woodpecker after him: Australopicus nelsonmandelai. In 1973, the physics institute at Leeds University named a nuclear particle the 'Mandela particle.' 4. He married a first lady: Before tying the knot with Mandela on his 80th birthday, Graca Machel was married to Mozambique President Samora Machel. Her marriage to Mandela after her husband's death means she has been the first lady of two nations. 5. He was a master of disguise: When Mandela was eluding authorities during his fight against apartheid, he disguised himself in various ways, including as a chauffeur. The press nicknamed him ""the Black Pimpernel"" because of his police evasion tactics. ""I became a creature of the night. I would keep to my hideout during the day, and would emerge to do my work when it became dark,"" he says in his biography, ""Long Walk to Freedom."" 6. A bloody sport intrigued him: Besides politics, Mandela's other passion was boxing. ""I did not like the violence of boxing. I was more interested in the science of it - how you move your body to protect yourself, how you use a plan to attack and retreat, and how you pace yourself through a fight,"" he says in his biography. 7. His favorite dish is probably not yours: He's been wined and dined by world leaders. But what Mandela loved eating most was tripe. Yup, the stomach lining of farm animals. 8. He quit his day job: He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and opened the nation's first black law firm in the city in 1952. 9. He was on the U.S. terror watch list: Mandela wasn't removed from the U.S. terror watch list until 2008 -- at age 89. He and other members of the African National Congress were placed on it because of their militant fight against apartheid. 10. He drew his inspiration from a poem: While he was in prison, Mandela would read William Ernest Henley's ""Invictus"" to fellow prisoners. The poem, about never giving up, resonated with Mandela for its lines ""I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul."" You may know it from the movie by the same name starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela.","He had a cameo in a Spike Lee film .

"When Jose Mourinho answered a question about the new £5billion television contract on Wednesday evening, spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of Chelsea fans listening in. ‘When I was living in Italy and Spain I was paying about £200 a month to have the Premier League at my house,’ he said. ‘I think the Premier League is better when I am here.’ He really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters. Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea backroom team celebrate the late winner against Everton on Wednesday . Mourinho embraces Branislav Ivanovic after Chelsea's Premier League victory at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho speaks to the media at the post-match press conference on Wednesday night . Sportsmail's team of reporters discuss whether Jose Mourinho's off-the-field antics are starting to harm his and the Premier League's reputations. Click HERE to read. With that razor-sharp quip he walked out, heading back towards the manager’s office at Stamford Bridge to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute. On Thursday night, when the FA announced that Branislav Ivanovic had escaped punishment for throttling Everton substitute James McCarthy and then laying his forehead on him, it was regarded by the club as a major victory. They ignored the rationale, the television pictures that clearly showed referee Jonathan Moss on the scene when Ivanovic grabbed McCarthy round the neck after Gareth Barry had nobbled Willian. The TV images showing Ivanovic’s head make contact with McCarthy’s left ear were inconclusive, according to a panel of three former referees. Because of that, Ivanovic has got off scot-free. This literally is a fight for the title, with Chelsea happy to antagonise the FA, the opposition, officials, TV companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour. Mourinho has everybody on the run and on Thursday it was the turn of the FA to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise Chelsea. Since 2005, Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have been charged six times by the FA for incidents that were not seen by the match official. Manchester United, Stoke City and Chelsea have been charged four times. The idea that there is a vendetta is a myth.

Ivanovic also clashes with Everton's John Stones in the closing stages of the Premier League match . Diego Costa (right) celebrates wildly after the final whistle is blown at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho (left) and assistant coach Steve Holland get animated against Everton on Wednesday night . Still, given Mourinho’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game, it would certainly help if the FA publicly clarified the position surrounding off-the-ball incidents. Confusion reigns. When he was questioned about Gary Cahill’s off-the-ball kick in the back of Harry Kane at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Mourinho responded with a query about Raheem Sterling’s escape for raising his hands to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. On Tuesday, Mourinho highlighted the FA’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player (Robin van Persie) for the glance at James Tomkins before the Manchester United man elbowed him at Upton Park on Sunday. From time to time, the Chelsea manager tosses in Arsene Wenger’s shove on him at Stamford Bridge on October 5, for which the Arsenal manager went unpunished. The memory plays tricks sometimes and Mourinho’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in 2007 after drawing 1-1 with Rosenborg. We are close to revisiting that era, returning to a period when English football had earned a rest from the Chelsea manager. Mourinho (right) and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during a match at Stamford Bridge last October . Mourinho (left) celebrates wildly after Chelsea beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium last year . Seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five-year deal, nothing has changed. It is a sad day when the normally mild-mannered Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland is seen haranguing the fourth official, as he did repeatedly on Wednesday. With coaching assistant Rui Faria, who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague Silvino Louro in a bearhug after Willian’s dramatic 89th-minute winner, it is to be expected. Now Holland is at it as well. In recent weeks, Chelsea’s technical area has become like the Dog & Duck at chucking out time. Someone needs to call time on it. What happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class? What a shame because Chelsea have a brilliant team, seven points clear of Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and hurtling towards the title. At this rate it is in danger of being tainted.

Why should English football accept this yobbish, boorish behaviour on the touchline from one of the world’s super coaches and his increasingly aggressive assistants? With the exception of Abramovich, there is no one on the Chelsea staff who is prepared to tell Mourinho to fall into line. There is no question who runs the show there. Not only that, he is being allowed to run rings around English football.","The FA announced on Thursday that Branislav Ivanovic escaped punishment after grabbing James McCarthy around the neck .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to India travel, the state of Punjab, which borders Pakistan, doesn't make it to the top of that many itineraries. That's good news for intrepid travelers. From temples so gold they'll make your eyes water, to food you'll be longing for days after it hits your lips, Punjab is India at its colorful, lively best. 1. Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) Located in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), is Punjab's top attraction. Reflections of its gold-encrusted dome shimmer in the clear water of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), which greets those who enter from the north gate, the most impressive of all four entries. To take it all in, it's best to simply walk around the marble pathway surrounding the pool. Its waters are said to have healing powers. Devotional music, bathing pilgrims, golden carps and meditating devotees add to the atmosphere. Worth keeping in mind: There's a long line to visit the inner sanctum (Darbar Sahib), where the holy book of the Sikhs, ""Guru Granth Sahib,"" is kept. Visits are best scheduled for the late afternoon and early evening; every night the temple complex is illuminated. Simply stunning. You can end the day at the temple's langar (canteen). The scale of its free meal, put on daily by volunteers, is impressive, with 50,000 meals served each day, according to temple officials. The Golden Temple, Golden Temple Road, Amritsar, Punjab; +91 183 255 3957; open daily, 6 a.m.-2 a.m. 2. Punjabi eats . The city of Amritsar has a rich culinary heritage. Building a big enough appetite to give it the attention it deserves is a challenge. From melt-in-mouth chicken tikka to cream-laden, extra-large tumblers of yogurt lassi, Amritsar is an Indian food lover's dream destination. The best way to get a balanced taste is to start in Kesar Da Dhaba. Hidden in the twisting lanes of the old part of the city, it's reached only by foot, cycle rickshaw or bicycle. Founded in 1916, the restaurant is particularly popular with vegetarians. There's crispy butter-smeared tandoori bread; the house specialty, daal makhani, comes with a thick layer of ghee. At Makhan Fish and Chicken Corner, fried singhara (catfish) fillets are a must-try. They're coated in chickpea flour and caraway seeds then cooked. Perfect with cold beer. The creamiest and freshest yogurt lassi in Amritsar is at Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar; the thick drink is a mini-meal in itself. Kesar da Dhaba, Chowk Passian; +91 183 255 2103 . Makhan Fish & Chicken Corner; 21A, Majitha Road, near Maddan Hospital; +91 98 1519 3241 . Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar, Chowk Regent Cinema, GT Road . 3. Border face off . One of Punjab's most interesting rituals is the lowering of the flags ceremony, held at India's Wagah border each evening before sunset. Wagah is about 25 kilometers from the Pakistani city of Lahore. Indian guards in red and gold turbans march out to meet their Pakistani counterparts in a choreographed affair greeted with loud applause from onlookers. It's a splendid show of patriotism, pomp and panache. To secure good seats, it's best to get there by midafternoon or arrange for a VIP pass from the Border Security Force station. For security reasons, bags and backpacks aren't allowed. The border is 30 kilometers from Amritsar and takes about 45 minutes to reach by car. 4. Punjabiyat Lodge . Punjabiyat Lodge doesn't conjure quintessential images of India. Instead what you get here are feather-light beds with unobstructed views of green fields as far as the eye can see. The nature retreat in Punjab's agricultural heartland is a great place to de-stress through simple rural experiences. Visitors can lend a helping hand to farmers, cycle around the village, milk cattle or take a tractor ride. Rooms are luxurious but eco-friendly. Guests get a sense of remoteness and privacy; there are only four cottages, all set in a wheat field. Meals are a pleasure. Breakfast is served near the fields, lunch under the shade of sprawling trees and dinner on a terrace under a canopy of stars. Most meals are made with ingredients grown on the lodge's farm, says Punjabiyat manager Jagdeep Singh. Punjabiyat Lodge is in the village of Saidowal-Gunopur, about 75 kilometers from Amritsar; +91 981 870 5508 . 5. Sarai Amanat Khan . A scenic 45-minute drive from Amritsar, Sarai Amanat Khan is an old, crumbling caravanserai (roadside inn). Built by Mughals in 1640, it's a fantastic remnant of ancient architecture. It once served travelers on the Agra-to-Lahore trade route and was a prosperous pit stop back in the day. These days, the historic ruins only hint at its glorious past. Photogenic features of the complex include an arched entry, fading calligraphy, Persian tiles, eroding walls and a mosque. Amanat Khan, the inn's namesake, is believed to be the same guy who etched the calligraphy on the Taj Mahal in Agra. It's a great day trip from Amritsar. 6. Ranjit's Svaasa hotel . There are few better ways to end a wild day in Amritsar than climbing into one of the plush beds at the 200-year-old Ranjit's Svaasa hotel. Abhimanyu and his partner, Gayatri, are the gracious hosts of this charming, well-hidden retreat. The owners are seventh-generation members of the Punjabi Mehra clan, says general manager Deepak Biala. Corridors are dotted with family portraits, antique furniture and curios collected over their many travels. Secluded terraces and lounging spaces are spread throughout the property. The Rattan Chand and Dev Chand suites each come with a marble bathtub and a sitting area framed by large windows. Guest can learn to whip up a traditional Punjabi meal or hit the spa for an innovative wine-and-sugar scrub or face treatment with turmeric, sandalwood and organic rose water.

"(CNN) -- Three Delaware day care workers were arrested after police got hold of a ""disturbing"" and ""shocking"" cell phone video that, authorities say, shows two toddlers taking part in a fight the workers had organized. Police said Tuesday that they arrested Tiana Harris, 19; Estefania Myers, 21; and Lisa Parker, 47, who have been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy. On Saturday, authorities responded to an unrelated incident and a person whom police would not identify showed them video of the 3-year-old boys fighting in March. The toddlers were not seriously injured, but they were ""clearly hurting each other,"" said Dover Police Capt. Tim Stump. Authorities have not released the video but say one day care worker said ""No pinching, only punching"" after one of the boys complained that the other had pinched him. The video purportedly shows seven other children seated in the room with their backs to the fighting, according to police. ""It's not like they didn't know what was going on, and they were just encouraging them to continue,"" Stump said. ""One of the children attempted to run, but one of the teachers pushes him back into the fray. ""We are looking into the possibility that this was not the first time it happened, but it appears to be isolated, and it seems the administration was in the dark about this,"" he added. Police made the arrests Monday and addressed the incident that evening with parents and guardians of the children who attended the day care center. A spokesman for the state Division of Family Services said the agency dispatched an institutional abuse investigator to work with Dover police during their investigation. ""Depending on our findings, these women could be prohibited from working in the public sector, especially with children or senior citizens,"" agency spokesman Joseph Smack said, adding that all three women had passed background checks before their employment at the center. ""It's rare to see a case like this where the staff encouraged this type of behavior,"" Smack said. Calls to the day care center were not returned, though police say the company's business license has been suspended. The three suspects and their attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment. Police said the women have posted $10,000 bail and are awaiting trial. More from CNN Justice .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Fixed Odds Betting Terminals  allow users to spend up to £100 a go and are blamed for a  rise in gambling . Betting machines dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ could spread to arcades and service stations as part of proposals from the amusement industry. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) are casino-style games which allow users to spend up to £100 a spin and are blamed for a worrying rise in problem gambling. They generate more than half of bookmakers’ profits. However they have been subject to greater restrictions since April, when new rules meant anyone wanting to spend over £50 must inform staff. Now BACTA, which represents the British amusement industry, is lobbying to be allowed to host the machines. In a letter to MPs and peers, the trade body says if the Government has not cracked down on the terminals, then they should be allowed in ‘any regulated adult-only gambling establishment’. It adds that it is ‘unfair’ to let betting shops reap all the benefits from the profitable machines. ‘The current situation... makes no sense and gives the bookmakers an unfair advantage,’ BACTA says. ‘If the Government deems [£50] a safe limit for bookmakers there is no reason that it is not safe for everybody.’ Campaigners say the amusement industry would have a strong case on competition grounds. There are around 33,000 FOBTs in the UK, but Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said this move could add another 8,000. Ministers are under pressure to allow the machines – which are currently only allowed in betting shops – to be more widespread across the UK after BACTA started lobbying for them to feature in the amusement industry . ‘How can the Government say, ‘No’ when they are saying to bookies that it is OK to have them?’ he said. BACTA confirmed its position but did not wish to comment further. A spokesman from the Department for Culture Media and Sport said: ‘The rules around where FOBTs can be based are very clear and they will not be moving into other areas.’","Fixed Odds Betting Terminals allow users to spend up to £100 on each spin .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Members of feminist punk band Pussy Riot have compared Australia’s asylum seeker policy to the Russian prisoner conditions at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas on Saturday night. Masha Alyokhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova opened their panel discussion at the Sydney Opera House, by addressing a proposal made by Australian activists that the pair boycott the festival, the Guardian reports. 'We were surprised by the problems here, such as detention camps, which are similar to what is happening in Russia,' Tolokonnikova told an audience in Sydney. Masha Alyokhina and Nadya Tolokonnikova opened their panel discussion at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas . The pair met activists on Friday night to discuss the calls for them to boycott the festival over links between its co-organisers at the St James Ethics Centre and the federal government's asylum seeker strategy. Instead of refusing to attend, the pair said that speaking at the festival would hopefully draw attention to the topic. The members also called on Australia to withdraw its invitation to President Vladimir Putin to attend this year's G20 summit. Members of a feminist punk band Pussy Riot have compared Australia's asylum seeker policy to the Russian prisoner conditions . Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were both sentenced to two years in jail after staging a protest performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012 . 'We think that this person has no place at the G20,' Alyokhina said. When Prime Minister Tony Abbott addressed calls for Putin to be excluded from the G20 on Friday, he said it was weighing on his mind. 'It's not a decision which Australia really has a right to make unilaterally,' he told reporters. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were both sentenced to two years in jail and were released from prison in December 2013 after staging a protest performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012. But the women said the situation in Russia was so repressive they would not be able to repeat their cathedral performance.

"Scathing: A report says Cliff Richard had his privacy violated during the police raid on his home . Sir Cliff Richard had his privacy violated after a secret deal between police and the BBC to film a raid on his house, a report says. The horrified pop star was left ‘unnecessarily distressed’ after learning police had swooped on his £3.5million home in Berkshire over a sex assault allegation dating from 1985 only when he saw it on TV while in Portugal. Images were beamed live around the world last August from a camera filming from a helicopter. Now a previously unpublished report says the deal between the BBC and the police should never have been done – suggesting Sir Cliff should not have been publicly humiliated in this way. It brands senior officials at South Yorkshire Police incompetent and calls the BBC dishonest for its explanation of how it came to know about the raid. After a BBC reporter approached the force, police chiefs allowed a reporting team including a camera crew to show officers searching the star’s home. The coverage caused a major row, and the findings by independent investigator and former chief constable Andy Trotter will reignite the controversy. Sir Cliff has not been arrested or charged. But many viewers said the BBC coverage made the 74-year-old singer look guilty. The damning report – released to the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act – concludes: . Mr Trotter says: ‘People have seen a search of Sir Cliff Richard’s apartment unfold on television with details of a serious allegation put into the public domain prior to him being interviewed by the police. Scroll down for video . Coverage: BBC reporter David Sillito outside Sir Cliff's home. His colleague Dan Johnson (not pictured) was invited in for a meeting with senior figures at South Yorkshire Police . Consequence: The deal struck between the force and the BBC led to detailed coverage of the raid on the complex where Sir Cliff had a flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire (pictured), including a news helicopter . The search and the nature of the allegation... certainly interfered with his privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress.’ He concludes that had the force refused to co-operate, the BBC would probably never have run the story. Although the BBC reporter, Dan Johnson, was not interviewed, Mr Trotter decided the corporation had not been fully open about how it came to hear about the allegation against Sir Cliff. The BBC claim – that Mr Johnson had persuaded South Yorkshire Police to agree the deal when all he knew was the name of the celebrity suspect – was ‘not one I believe to be credible’, Mr Trotter said. Evidence supported the police account that Mr Johnson had detailed knowledge and ‘knew as much’ as police did when he made contact. The BBC has never revealed the source of the original information. Up close: The footage of the raid showed several investigators entering and had images inside the house . News event: But Sir Cliff, who maintains his innocence, has not been arrested or charged over the claim . Sir Cliff has called the allegation that he sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in 1985 ‘completely false’. He was interviewed by police under caution and, more than six months on, inquiries are on-going. Mr Trotter was asked to investigate police handling of the raid by police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. Analysis reveals the BBC journalist contacted the force’s communications director Carrie Goodwin on July 14 after an alleged leak from Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into abuse claims involving Jimmy Savile. A meeting was held the next day with Mr Johnson and Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who agreed to tell him the date and location of the raid in exchange for him holding the story until that day to protect the investigation. The chief constable was also informed of the agreement. Mr Trotter said Miss Goodwin should not have arranged the meeting with Mr Fenwick, not have confirmed any information about the inquiry to the BBC reporter and not have agreed to notify him of the search. Mr Fenwick should have refused to meet or disclose any details to the BBC. And Chief Constable David Crompton ‘could have rescinded the agreement’. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ The BBC was not directly involved in Mr Trotter’s review. A spokesman said: ‘The home affairs committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add.’ A spokesman for Sir Cliff said he would not comment.","Sir Cliff first saw raid on his £3.5m Berkshire home on TV last August .

"Driving tests should have a distinction grade to improve road safety, a Tory minister has said. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said it is wrong that would-be drivers can only pass or fail. He said that if there was a higher level to aspire to, insurance firms would be able to offer cheaper premiums to the best drivers – which could make the country’s roads safer. Test: Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident (file picture) It comes after the Government said it was considering raising the driving age to 18 – from the current 17 – in a attempt to reduce the number of fatal accidents. Youths could be forced to wait until they are 19 before they qualify for a full licence, and all motorists under 30 could be banned from giving their friends a lift or driving at night for 12 months after they pass their test. Almost a quarter of the road accidents resulting in death or serious injury last year involved a driver under 24. That age group is roughly four times more likely to be involved in a serious accident. Mr Hancock, who is Conservative MP for West Suffolk, made his suggestion at a car factory in Oxford last week, at an event where apprentices met David Cameron. ‘One of the things that’s in the . implementation platform is that every apprenticeship in the future will . have a pass, fail or distinction,’ he said. Fifteen minors allowed: Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked (file picture) ‘I’m personally very committed to this. People say ... you can be a perfectly good bricklayer or you can be brilliant. Parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up their children from school could soon find themselves caught on camera. The cameras, which are timed to switch on during the morning and afternoon school run, spot those who stop in restricted zones. The surveillance system records footage of the number plate and no-parking sign and sends it to councils, which can then use it  to issue fines of up to £120. Five councils in London and at least two others outside the capital are testing the system, which costs £16,000. Manufacturer Videalert refused to say which they were. Actor Tom Conti, 71, who drops his grandchild off at school in London, compared the camera system to surveillance by the Stasi. He said: ‘The councils are doing this for revenue. To target parents is frankly disgusting.’ ‘People say the driving test is just pass or fail. But actually if we had a distinction on the driving test, maybe those people could get lower premiums and be safer drivers.’ Currently, learner drivers are given some indication of how they fared by seeing their report card at the end of the test, on which their minor or major faults are marked. Up to 15 minors are allowed before they will be failed. Sources at the Department for Business and Skills said it was not official Government policy to have a distinction level, but that it was an idea Mr Hancock was in favour of. He is particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne, meaning his thoughts are discussed at the highest levels. Last night Edmund King, president of the AA, said the idea was ‘interesting’ and could help make roads safer. He said the distinction pass could be reserved for those who excelled in their tests and completed advanced lessons. ‘Young drivers are not ready for Britain’s roads after passing their tests,’ he said. ‘They are ten times more likely to have an accident in the first year after passing their test. ‘The idea of having a distinction is interesting. If a new driver has completed lessons on motorways and driving at night and excelled at their test they could get a lower insurance premium.’","Matthew Hancock says it's wrong would-be drivers can only pass or fail .

 Lindsay Lohan worked like crazy and completed 115 hours of community service in Brooklyn to meet her Thursday deadline and avoid jail, a source confirmed to the Daily News. 
  
 “She finished last night or today,” the well-placed source said Wednesday. 
  
 And while the prosecutor on her case contested a prior batch of hours served overseas in London, Santa Monica City Attorney Terry White said Wednesday that he plans to accept the new Brooklyn hours when they’re presented at a Los Angeles hearing Thursday morning. 
  
 “It does appear that Ms. Lohan has completed her community service hours, and at this point I am not anticipating any sort of challenge to the hours,” White told The News Wednesday.

 It was three weeks ago on May 7 that a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge said Lohan could race to Brooklyn from her new home in London and try to complete 115 hours of service with the charity group Brooklyn Community Services (BCS) by a May 28 deadline. 
  
 He warned that the deadline was firm, and jail was on the table.

 “She’s had three years to take care of this. If it’s not done by May 28, there will be consequences,” Judge Mark A. Young said.

 Lohan, 28, got off to a rocky start, missing her first day at BCS’s Duffield Children’s Center in Fort Greene on May 12. But she started the next morning and powered through back-to-back full-day shifts at the daycare center, a women’s shelter in East New York and possibly other BCS groups. 
  
 Her lawyer Shawn Holley is expected to appear on her behalf and submit the proof of service Thursday. 
  
 If the judge signs off, Lohan could wrap up her 2012 reckless driving case and be off probation for the first time since her conviction for back-to-back DUIs in 2007. 
  
 The “Mean Girls” actress originally was ordered to complete 240 hours of community service by last November to satisfy probation for her June 2012 car crash on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica. 
  
 She scored an extension when a judge agreed to give her more time as she acted in a London production of the David Mamet play “Speed the Plow"" late last year.

 Lohan later rushed to meet the extended deadline in January and thought she made the cut until prosecutors objected. 
  
 White questioned how Lohan was able to complete 10 hours on Jan. 19 considering she went to an emergency room that day for treatment of a mosquito-borne virus she purportedly picked up in Bora Bora. 
  
 “(A) note says she received acute care for three days, but on those three days, again, 10 hours were served,” he said with exasperation in late January. 
  
 “I’m having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or not the work was actually done,” he told the judge. 
  
 She agreed to serve 125 hours by May 28 to settle the dispute and had 115 to go as of her last hearing. 
  
 Lohan’s service with BCS appeared to go well with parents offering their support and the former child star keeping a low profile.

"A man who bit a dog during an altercation outside a corner shop later ran inside and died from a suspected heart attack after 'being restrained', it has emerged. The man, who is in his forties, bit the dog – believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – during a dispute with a 45-year-old man in Cambridge. He then ran into a nearby One Stop convenience shop, reportedly in his socks, and died a short time later, after allegedly being held by four men. The man, in his forties, bit the dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier - during a dispute with a 45-year-old man outside a One Stop shop (pictured) in Cambridge. He later died of a suspected heart attack inside . Police and paramedics were called to the store following the incident at about 6.30am on Monday, having received reports of a man in cardiac arrest. The man, who is believed to live in the area but has not yet been formally identified, was pronounced dead a short time later. A post mortem examination to determine his cause of death proved inconclusive, police said. Further tests will now be carried out at Peterborough City Hospital, including a toxicology test. Four men, aged 40, 44, 69, and 50, from  Cambridgeshire, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death. They have since been released on bail until February 11. A 45-year-old man, who was allegedly involved in the original dispute outside the shop, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm but has since been released without charge. Police said no further action would be taken. Witnesses to the incident described seeing two men 'shouting and struggling' in the street, prior to the man's death. Samantha Lander, a resident on Dudley Road, told Cambridge News that she was awoken by the sound of shouting and looked out of the window to see a struggle, which appeared to involve a dog that looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier. It is believed the man who died had run off into the shop following the dispute and was being restrained by four men in the store when he became unwell. East of England Ambulance Service confirmed a rapid response car, ambulance and an air ambulance were sent to the scene after receiving reports of a man having a cardiac arrest. A spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.51am on Monday and were on scene in seven minutes. 'Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone involved a male patient sadly died at the scene.' The spokesman confirmed paramedics performed CPR on the patient. Police said they received reports that the man had bit a dog outside the convenience store in Cambridge (pictured) during the dispute and later ran off into the store, where he passed away a short time later . Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the man's death was being treated as 'unexplained' but confirmed it was not deemed to be suspicious. A spokesman said: 'The death of a man on December 15 in Cambridge is being treated as unexplained by police. 'The man, who is in his 40s and from Cambridge, died after police were called to an incident at a premises in Ditton Lane at just after 6.30am.

"They were taken on as volunteers and the service has since decided to employ an extra four full-time counsellors.
Documents seen by the BBC show its welfare and counselling team was almost halved between 2008 and June 2017.
The London Fire Brigade said the mental health of staff was a ""main priority"".
At least 80 people died in the fire in North Kensington on 14 June.
More than 200 firefighters attended the tower block at the time, rescuing 65 people.
The extra four full-time counsellors would effectively return staffing levels to those in 2008.
The BBC understands there was the equivalent of 9.6 full-time counsellors working for the brigade in 2008. By the time of the fire, the number had been cut to 5.2.
The London Fire Brigade is using its reserve budget to pay for the extra counsellors.
But London Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the government asking for it to provide extra funding for the fire service's staffing, as well as aerial appliances and improved breathing apparatus.
The fire service did not confirm the extent of the support the 60 voluntary counsellors have given or if they are still being used.
Siobhan McGee, a trauma specialist and former London Fire Brigade counsellor, said while firefighters were generally ""very resilient people"" it was normal for symptoms of traumatic stress to occur following a tragedy such as the Grenfell fire.
""They may be experiencing things like physically shaking in their body, elevated heart-rate,"" she told Victoria Derbyshire.
""They might have disturbed sleep, they might have nightmares, they might have induced images and flashbacks.""
She said over time, as trauma memory is processed by the brain, images and memories become less distressing.
A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said every firefighter who attended Grenfell was individually spoken to by a counsellor before they came off duty.
""When they returned to duty our staff also had access to a counsellor, and the brigade counselling team was reinforced by officer support from the NHS and other fire and rescue services,"" the spokesman said.
""Going forward, counsellors are visiting staff this week and carrying out a psychological health check of each individual and identifying further staff who might need support.
""We have an on-call counsellor available to all staff 24/7. The ongoing mental wellbeing of all of our staff continues to be a main priority.""
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","An extra 60 counsellors were drafted in by the London Fire Brigade to help firefighters traumatised by the Grenfell Tower fire, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned."

 He drives five to six more hours until he reaches the new address in the sand and waits for the next text, containing another set of coordinates. The process is repeated a minimum of three times before the jihadists finally show themselves.

By one recent al-Qaeda estimate, ransoms covered half of its expenses.

"(CNN) -- The World Cup's focus on attacking football has won global praise but a cloud scurried across the tournament Tuesday as match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon's participation in the event emerged. The Cameroon Football Association (Fecafoot) has confirmed it's investigating allegations made in the German media that seven of its players were involved in match fixing during the group stages of the World Cup finals in Brazil. While previous investigations centered on trying to fix international friendlies or low-profile qualifiers, this is the first time since 1982 that World Cup group stage games have come under scrutiny. The ""Indomitable Lions"" were drawn in the same pool as Croatia, Mexico and host nation Brazil, losing all three games. A convicted match fixer spoke to German magazine Der Spiegel correctly predicting one of the results of the African nation. ""We wish to inform the general public that, though not yet contacted by FIFA in regards to this affair, our administration has already instructed its Ethics Committee, to further investigate these accusations,"" said a Fecafoot statement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was detained by police in Finland earlier this year on an international arrest warrant, told Der Spiegel that Cameroon would lose to Croatia while also having a player sent off. CNN has not been able to independently verify the Der Spiegel report. Midfielder Alex Song was red carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, while goals from Ivica Olic, Ivan Perisic and a brace from Mandzukic without reply secured a 4-0 victory. The match also saw Cameroon players Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Benjamin Moukandjo aggressively confront each other, with television pictures appearing to show Assou-Ekotto attempting to head-butt Moukandjo. CNN contacted Song's agent although he was not immediately available for comment. The Fecafoot statement continued: ""Recent allegations of fraud around Cameroon 2014 FIFA World Cup three preliminary games, especially Cameroon vs. Croatia, as well of the 'existence of seven bad apples (in our national team)' do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of Conduct and the ethics of our nation."" In the Der Spiegel interview, Perumal, who CNN is trying to contact, used the expression ""seven bad apples."" A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that they could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the manipulation of games. Fecafoot meanwhile added in its statement that ""in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind."" The investigation marks an uncomfortable end to Cameroon's disastrous World Cup campaign. Players initially refused to board the plane to Brazil until a dispute with Fecafoot over bonus payments was resolved. Although an agreement was eventually reached, the team's departure was delayed by a day. An opening game 1-0 loss to Mexico was followed up by the 4-0 thrashing by Croatia. Hosts Brazil then completed the misery by defeating the four-time African Cup of Nations champion 4-1. In the aftermath of the Croatia defeat, coach Volker Finke described the behavior of some of his players as ""unacceptable."" ""Some players behaved very badly, and that's why we have conceded four goals,"" Finke said to L'Equipe. ""I know that it is difficult to play with 10 men, but that is not a reason to lose it to this point. ""The game was balanced until the red card. The Croatians were more clinical in front of goal, but Cameroon also had chances to score. ""The behavior of some of the players is really not satisfactory. Even when we were 11-a-side, it was not acceptable."" In 1982, Algeria, despite having beaten then West Germany, went out after a seemingly contrived 1-0 win over Austria.","Cameroon to investigate allegations of match fixing by its players at the World Cup .

The six-year-old, a three-time group one winner in 2013, has raced three times since returning to training this summer after encountering fertility problems at stud, winning the 10-furlong Group Three Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor before finishing fifth to The Grey Gatsby in the Irish Champion Stakes last time out. Charlton, whose dual Group Three winning miler Captain Cat tries to win his first Group Two prize in the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘The step up in trip and step down in class is just Al Kazeem needs.’ Al Kazeem will run in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot a week on Saturday . Roger Charlton believes the step up in trip and step down in class is just what Al Kazeem needs . The Cumberland Lodge Stakes was an option for Jeremy Noseda’s Grandeur but the gelding, who has run three times without luck across the Atlantic this summer, will again be on his travel with a shot at the $1million Canadian International at Woodbine on October 19. The five-year-old won the Listed Foundation Stakes at Goodwood for the second year running but Noseda will be have to look for a new jockey in Canada. Wednesday’s rider Ryan Moore should be needed for Sir Michael Stoute-trained Hillstar, a winner at Newbury on Saturday. Noseda’s Newmarket colleague Roger Varian may have just won his first Classic with Kingston Hill in the St Leger but there was one surprising omission from his CV. Until Andre Atzeni-ridden 15-8 favourite American Artist passed the post first in the British Stallions Stud Maiden Stakes, Varian had never had a winner at Goodwood from 50 runners in his four-year training career. Varian confirmed that Kingston Hill was on course for a crack at the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on October 5, saying: ‘It is all systems go – I have been very pleased with his since the Leger.’ Roger Varians says Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season . Varian also refused to rule out the possibility that his Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes winner Cursory Glance might run again this season. Moore was also successful on his father Gary’s Good Luck Charm. That stretched his title race lead to five (142-137) over Richard Hughes, who also picked up a two-day whip ban on runner-up Shadow Rock.","Six-year-old has raced three times since encountering fertility problems .

Protest groups and 15 councils will seek to stop the Government’s controversial £34billion high speed HS2 rail project dead in its tracks when they challenge the ‘fundamentally flawed’ project in the High Court from Monday. Ahead of the legal battle they warned ministers: ’You may ignore our protests but you can’t ignore the courts.’ Teams of barristers led by QCs will present five separate legal challenges against the Department for Transport on environmental and financial grounds over a nine day period to prevent the ‘damning blight’ of homes and countryside close to the line. Money wasted: Protesters say the new HS2 project has been 'an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money' The judicial reviews are being launched by the umbrella group 51M representing 15 councils along the route, two challenges by the HS2 Action Alliance, as well as Heathrow Hub Ltd and Aylesbury Park Golf Club. The first phase of the scheme for the 225mph trains involves a 143 mile route from London to Birmingham by 2026, followed by a ‘Y’ shaped split to Leeds and Manchester in the North by 2033. Objections to be put to the High Court include Government failure to provide accurate information, failure to comply to environmental statute, failure to assess the impact on communities, failure to adequately assess alternatives, failure to consider the impact of HS2 on other parts of the transport infrastructure, and that the decision on compensation failed to meet Government promises and relied on ‘undisclosed information’. Proceedings start on Monday December 3 and is expected to conclude Tuesday December 11 with the councils first to fire their legal broadside . Transport mess: High Speed HS2 protest poster showing former Transport Secretary Justine Greening and current one Patrick McLoughlin portrayed as Laurel and Hardy . Councillor Martin Tett, Chairman of the 51m alliance and leader of Buckinghamshire County Council said: ‘We are doing this with immense reluctance; however we feel that we have been left with no alternative. ‘ . He said the project has ‘an abysmal business case and represents extremely poor value for hard pressed taxpayers' money’. ‘Far better alternatives exist to . build the infrastructure the country desperately needs more quickly and . at far lower cost. We cannot let the Department for Transport with its . atrocious record on managing key investment decisions not answer for why . these have been ignored.’ Councillor Sarah Hayward, Leader of . Camden Council, said: ‘The judicial review enables us to highlight the . impact of this fundamentally flawed scheme, through the legal system. ‘This scheme will bring a damning . blight to Camden that could last for decades, and the council will fight . for every home and business, brick by brick.’ Stop HS2 Campaign Coordinator Joe .

Penny Gaines, who chaise the Stop HS2 . campaign said: 'The Department for Transport have failed in their duty . to adequately assess the environmental impact of HS2.‘ . Hilary Wharf , Director, HS2 Action . Alliance said: ‘The Government is trying to force through HS2 without . following proper process.  Our cases concern environmental issues and . the consultation on compensation.’ ‘We are confident in our arguments.

'My partner has built a business in Essex over the last five years and we were hoping to move to be closer to his work. 'But as our house is 400 metres from the proposed line we are not entitled to any compensation and we are left with a big mortgage on a house that is effectively worthless.’ A Department for Transport spokesman  said: ’HS2 will bring cities closer together, drive regeneration, tackle overcrowding and stimulate economic growth. ‘While it would not be appropriate to comment on the specific claims, the Government is confident that the decisions on HS2 have been taken lawfully and fairly and it is vigorously defending these legal challenges.’ The Prime Minister this week gave a ‘personal undertaking’ to review compensation schemes for properties affected by the planned high speed 2 rail link after being challenged by his former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan. Ms Gillan, whose Chesham and Amersham seat will be home to part of the route, urged a generous package for those who live and work nearby.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices on Monday heard six separate appeals, which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is narrow, but potentially far-reaching -- whether the Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emissions standards for ""stationary"" greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming. In the larger political sphere, this issue could be major test of executive authority, with many conservative groups painting President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of the legislature. Obama just last week announced new executive rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted the President to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing the Obamacare health reform law, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally-married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Supreme Court, in 2007, affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases-- including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions-- are an air pollutant, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. A range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority to stationary sources. They worry the unchecked, expanded rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. Defining ""air pollutant"" within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the EPA to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the half-dozen parties opposing the EPA cannot even agree on defining an ""air pollutant"" for regulatory purposes . ""That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the"" EPA, said Sotomayor. ""So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the agency?"" But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could prove the court's decisive fifth vote, bluntly addressed U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. ""I have to say in reading the brief for the states and reading your brief, I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position,"" he said. Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases are under review by the high court. The justices had previously rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia -- broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years, and could rule in this case against the administration. But an outcome in this his case was not clear from the arguments. ""We have to think about it, along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program,"" Peter Keisler, the attorney representing the private groups bringing suit, told the court. Justice Elena Kagan, the most vocal backer of the administration, said the Clean Air Act was originally passed and amended before a clear understanding of the effect greenhouses gases were having on the planet. She said the EPA made a careful determination that they were different from pollution sources that cause breathing and other health problems, such as smog, and could apply different monitoring standards. ""What's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one,"" said Kagan. ""It said: 'Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.' And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do?"" she asked. Verrilli made clear the stakes in his oral presentation, telling the court that greenhouse gas emissions are ""an urgent environmental"" issue. ""It's the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as EPA's judgment, and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time,"" he said. But some justices questioned the agency's reach. ""Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito. ""Could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?"" After Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts pressed the point, Verrilli suggested the EPA could broaden its discretionary authority, absent a specific congressional mandate. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices in December heard arguments over the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. A ruling in that case is still pending. Many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation. The cases argued Monday are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (12-1146).","Supreme Court hears six appeals during oral arguments .

"By . Aap . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told an inquiry into the treatment of children in detention about the 'moral burden' and 'emotional challenges' of his job, but says indulging in sentiment will result in more asylum seeker deaths at sea. Mr Morrison made the comments during his opening statement into an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry hearing into the treatment of children in detention. 'There is much emotion in this serious topic that is before your inquiry. There should be,' he told AHRC president Gillian Triggs in Canberra. Scroll down for video . Immigration minister Scott Morrison speaking during a public hearing of the Human Right Commission at Parliament House in Canberra today . 'As a parent of two young children, the emotional challenges of working in this policy portfolio are just as real and just as great [as] they would be any other parent in my position. 'But sentiment cannot be indulged at the expense of effective policy that is saving lives and ending the chaos and tragedy that was occurring.' He said the Australian people decided at the last election that enough children had drowned while seeking asylum. 'There is no decision that I, or any of my predecessors, take as a minister in this area that is free of moral burden.' A group of asylum seekers are transported to Christmas Island in July 2012 after their boat issued a distress signal . 150 children will be released from mainland detention centres into the community. But approximately 700 children will remain in detention on Christmas Island (pictured) and on Nauru . The inquiry comes as this week Mr Morrison announced that 150 children held in mainland detention centres would be released into the community on bridging visas by the end of the year. Approximately 700 children will remain in detention centres, including those in Nauru and on Christmas Island. Concerns have been raised by refugee advocacy groups about the effect mandatory detention has on children, with allegations of physical and sexual abuse and deprivation outlined in a recent report released by the Australian Human Rights Commission. However Mr Morrison said the inquiry should be investigating his Labor predecessors, under whose watch most of the children arrived in Australia. Mr Morrison expressed disappointment the commission had not sought testimony from his four Labor predecessors, given more than 8,469 children arrived in Australia by boat during the Labor years. 'I invite the commission to rectify this situation by extending an invitation to my predecessors,' he said. Under the Abbott government, more children had been released from detention than put in, he said. He said just 353 children had arrived in Australia by boat since the September election, while 537 were released from detention - with the further 150 to come out in coming months. A drawing done by a six-year-old asylum seeker currently detained in Australian . There have been allegations that the conditions of the detention centres could cause depression and trauma for the children . Prof Triggs pressed Mr Morrison for any evidence that detaining children for long periods of time had a deterrence effect. 'There appears to be no connection between these two,' she said. People she had interviewed in mainland centres and on Christmas Island had 'no idea' of that aspect of government's policy. But Mr Morrison said detention of young children was merely a consequence of the government's policy not to allow refugees to be processed in Australia. That was followed by a heated exchange about whether detention facilities employed armed guards and resembled prisons. Prof Triggs said there was no way into the centres except through armed guards. Immigration department secretary Martin Bowles took issue, categorically denying armed guards work at the centres and calling on Prof Triggs to retract her statement. The commissioner then claimed conditions on Christmas Island were similar to those of prisons, prompting Mr Morrison to query whether she was comparing the facility with Long Bay jail. Prof Triggs said she would like to move on. Mr Morrison blamed the government's lack of movement on processing tens of thousands of backlogged refugee applications on the Senate, which was refusing to pass the reintroduction of temporary visas. The government's policy was to no longer grant permanent visas to refugees meaning there was no visa available for them, he said. 'And the government is not going to allow a set of policies to be weakened that would see an Australian staring into the face of a child corpse again,' he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Hugh Hefner founded Playboy magazine 55 years ago and turned the adult-oriented publication into a multimillion-dollar empire. CNN anchor John Roberts recently sat down with Hefner, now 82, and talked about Steven Watts' new book, ""Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream."" Hugh Hefner, 82, says that ""staying young is what it is all about for me."" John Roberts, CNN anchor: Mr. Hefner, good to see you. Hugh Hefner: It is my pleasure. Roberts: You have over the decades certainly supported political causes, you've supported Democratic causes. I'm wondering what your thoughts are regarding the pending inauguration of Barack Obama and where you think the country is headed in the next four years. Hefner: Well, where the country is headed is obviously a question we would all like to know. But I, certainly, [say] this [is] a time for a change. I supported Obama. I'm delighted that I lived to see a black president. I think he's a very good man. I think we've had ... eight of the worst years in my memory. And we hope that Obama can make some difference.  Watch the interview with Hugh Hefner » . Roberts: You know in the 1950s and through the '60s and the early '70s you were such a factor in the sexual revolution in this country. With the election of Barack Obama, do you believe that the cultural revolution has come to an end? Hefner: It's always ongoing. You know, we remain essentially a puritan people. And so I think that conflict is always there. One got a remarkable revolutionary change in pop culture and in moral values in the '60s and '70s, and then there was a backlash. And that backlash, I think, has influenced government. And, um, the Christian right has had, played a major role in all of that. And I think that the complicated problems with religion being involved with politics hopefully will come to an end for a while at least. Roberts: Now in 1953, when you first launched Playboy magazine, you seemed to be the right publication for the right time. I know that you were very heavily influenced by the Kinsey Report, which had come out not too long prior to that. But 55 years later, is Playboy magazine still relevant? And if it is, how do you keep it relevant? Hefner: Well, I don't think obviously it will ever play the same kind of role that it played back in the 1950s and '60s. But I do think that a magazine of quality always has a place. Increasingly, obviously fewer people are reading magazines and fewer people are reading newspapers and books, but I think that part of that is a change that Playboy is always, is also embracing. We're very much involved with the Internet. We were the first magazine to use [the] Internet and have our own Web site. So I think that we'll continue to publish and publish both the magazine and then publish through electronics. Roberts: The new Steven Watts biography is a fascinating, very fascinating look at your entire career, from your roots all the way up until the present. And he says, looking back over it, that ""the key to his approach was that he edited Playboy for himself. Aiming it at his own tastes and values."" Was that also a key to your success as well that you approached this with such a personal passion? Hefner: I think so, but I think that is one of the things that makes magazines unique. They do speak with a personal voice. And I think it is one of the things that makes magazines special. Roberts: Now this, of course, has been a family enterprise. You founded the magazine, your daughter Christie took over as CEO of the company in 1982. She has been there for 26 years, but she's stepping down later on this month. Will you be able to still maintain that same - I don't want to say ""quality"" because I'm sure the quality was there -- but can the business continue in the fashion it has for the past 55 years? Hefner: Well, only time will tell. If you're talking in terms of family connections, I have two teenage sons. As a matter fact, there was an interview with Marston and Cooper in the current January issue. Roberts: I saw it. Hefner: Marston has just turned 18 and is at Trinity College. Cooper will be graduating in June and will be going to USC, and both have an interest in the magazine. Roberts: So you'll be able to continue that legacy into the future? Hefner: That is my hope. Roberts: Hugh, in the early part of the 1980s you ran into a number of problems. You were attacked on a number of different fronts by Reagan conservatives, the feminist movement, business started to suffer. Of course, there was the murder of 1980 Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten and charges that you had exploited her. A recent article in the Baltimore Sun described those times this way. It said: . ""Many now viewed Hefner as an anachronism: A creepy old guy padding around the mansion in slippers, pajamas and smoking jacket, pathetically cavorting with the same young bimbos and living the dissolute life of an aging Lothario -- the sexualized Peter Pan who refused to grow up."" How did you overcome all that and survive another 25 years in the way that you have? Hefner: Well, I think that's probably the great question. One of the big questions is ""Why is the brand so hugely popular again?"" There was a period in the '80s and '90s on which we were in the shade, and the brand has become hugely popular again. Part of it because of the television show. The television show is a global phenomenon. And what is unique about it is the fact that it is more popular with women than with men. Roberts: I know. The program you are talking about is girls gone wild ... sorry, ""Girls Next Door."" It's heading into its sixth season. And one of the statistics I saw is that 78 percent of the viewers are women. How do you think you've tapped into that market? Hefner: Well, we certainly didn't anticipate it. The original notion of doing the show through the eyes of the girlfriends seemed inspired because it took a lot of the pressure off of me. Because I'm a very busy guy. I still am very busy involved with the business and with the magazine. So the notion of doing a reality show through the eyes of the girls was a good idea because it took the pressure off the old man. What we didn't anticipate, of course, was as a result ... it is a hugely popular phenomenon with women and that, of course, is really welcome. Because we knew that we were going to have the guys so the fact that the magazine and the brand is now hot with young women bodes well for the future. Roberts: Of course, the three principals in ""Girls Next Door"" are Holly, Bridget and Kendra, and we know that there has been a bit of a change in the relationship between you and Holly, at the very least. Will they be back again next year for the next season? Hefner: Yes, all three of the girls are scheduled for season six. It will be a season of transitions and we will be meeting some of the new girls, too. Roberts: You're 82 years old now? Your latest girlfriends are a pair of 19-year-old twins, Karissa and Kristina Shannon. You are 63 years older than they are. A lot of people would say, ""How do you do it?"" And other people might say, ""Are you ever going to grow up?"" Hefner: Well, I'm never going to grow up. Staying young is what it is all about for me. Holding on to the boy and, um, long ago I decided that age really didn't matter and as long as the ladies ... feel the same way, that's fine with me. Roberts: Well, you're definitely the youngest 82-year-old I've ever seen. Hugh Hefner, thanks for being with us today. Hefner: My pleasure always. Roberts: Take care. Hefner: Thank you.","New book about publisher is ""Mr. Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream""

"Russia's economic development ministry estimates the economy will contract by 0.8% next year.
It had previously estimated the the economy would grow by 1.2% in 2015.
Russia's reliance on tax revenues from the oil industry makes it particularly sensitive to price movements.
Household disposable incomes are also forecast to decline by as much as 2.8%, compared with a previous estimate that they would grow by 0.4%.
The sharp revision in Russia's economic forecast is the first admission from the government that the economy will contract.
""The current prognosis is based on a drop in GDP by 0.8% in 2015, against the previous prognosis of growth by 1.2%,"" deputy prime minister Alexi Vedev said.
On Monday, the rouble suffered its biggest one-day fall since 1998.
The currency slid almost 9% against the dollar before rallying after suspected central bank intervention. The currency has already lost 40% in value this year.
The Russian finance ministry has also not ruled out spending more than 500 billion roubles from the budget's Reserve Fund next year.
The 2015-2017 budget allows for spending of up to 500bn roubles (Â£5.9bn) next year from the Reserve Fund, but Maxim Oreshkin, head of the finance ministry's long-term strategic planning department, said it was possible the government could spend more to support the economy.
He added that if the average oil price were $80 per barrel in 2015, the finance ministry's forecast for a fall in GDP was in line with the economy ministry's prediction of a 0.8% contraction.
He also said that a scenario in which the oil price averaged $60 a barrel in 2015 was pessimistic, and at that price, the Russian economy would contract as forecast in the central bank's ""stress scenario"".
The bank published its stress scenario last month, saying that at $60 per barrel, GDP would decline by 3.5% to 4%.
""The real damage from the collapsing rouble and oil price is to investment and growth,'' said Chris Weafer, senior partner at Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, in a note to investors.
""Russia is a non-investible country for all but the bravest of hedge fund investors right now, and will remain in this category until both the rouble and oil stabilise at minimum.""
The price of oil has fallen nearly 40% since the summer because of oversupply caused by rising US shale oil production.
Demand has also fallen, particularly in China, the world's second largest consumer of the commodity, where industrial production has slowed in recent months.
Last week, Opec ministers met to discuss a possible cut in oil production in order to stabilise the oil price, but the meeting broke up without agreement.
Opec secretary general Abdallah Salem el-Badri said: ""There's a price decline. That does not mean that we should really rush and do something.""
The fall in the oil price has been causing concern for several members of the oil cartel, as most require a price above $80 a barrel to balance their government budgets and many need prices to be above $100 a barrel.","The Russian government has warned the economy will fall into recession next year as Western sanctions, in response to its role in eastern Ukraine, and falling oil prices begin to bite."
"A rare megamouth shark washed up on a beach dead in the Philippines this week, wildlife officials have said. The 15-foot shark, a Megachasma pelagios (giant mouth of the deep), was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province. It is only the 60th megamouth shark seen in the world, according to marine biologist Christopher Bird. Scroll down for video . Fishermen use a stretcher with steels bars to carry a rare megamouth shark, which was found dead on a beach in the Phillipines . The Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines said the shark is being stored in an ice plant until a necropsy can be performed. The shark, nicknamed 'Toothless', was already dead when it washed ashore and the cause of death is unknown. It was carried inside by fishermen in a net and preserved in ice by local villagers. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Albay province will investigate to determine the cause of the shark's death. In July last year, an 18-foot megamouth was caught by Filipino fishermen. The 15-foot shark was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province . This megamouth shark is displayed after being discovered in Tokyo Bay near Ichihara City in 2004 . Most have been found in Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan, but the first confirmed megamouth shark sighting came in 1976, when a deep-sea anchor accidentally caught one near Hawaii. A megamouth shark can reach to a maximum length of 17 feet and have a life span of up to 100 years, according to Reuters. The species lives in deep waters but rises towards the surface at night to feed or eat plankton.

"Global warming is claimed to be already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning because of melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. Now experts have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of the bears’ penis bones. This puts them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species. Not in rude health: Scientists have warned that chemical pollutants may be reducing the density of polar bears' penis bones. This puts the them at risk of breaking their penis, which could have disastrous consequences for mating and the survival of the endangered species (stock image) Mammals such as otters have a penis bone, or baculum, which is thought to be a by-product of evolution, although experts are not sure. Now, a team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, has found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is associated with a less dense penile bone, New Scientist reported. They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, such as PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes. Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs. PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer. The connection: A team of scientists led by Christian Sonne at Aarhus University, Denmark, have found that a certain type of pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a less dense penile bone. An illustration of a toxic PCB 126 molecule is shown . Uncertain future: Global warming is already posing problems for polar bears, whose numbers are waning thanks to melting ice, dangerous conditions and fewer hunting opportunities. A stock image is shown . Because they break down slowly, they can still be found in the Arctic, meaning that animals such as polar bears are especially at risk. Together with a team from Canada, Dr Sonne examined buculum specimens from 279 polar bears that were born in north-east Greenland and Canada between 1990 and 2000. They used X-rays to study the density of calcium in the bones and then compared their findings with regional pollutant data. Experts have previously shown that bears that have high levels of pollutants  in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bone. A collection of ancient bones is shown . The team discovered a connection between low bone density and high PCB levels, but stressed that their findings are not strong enough to prove that the pollutants are the cause of the problem. While experts are unsure of the exact purpose of the bacculum in polar bear mating, Dr Sonne thinks that a weaker bone could prove problematic, because if it breaks, it will likely stop a male from mating. While no extensive studies in the wild have been done to understand the effect pollutants on polar bear populations - because they are difficult and expensive - Dr Sonne thinks chemicals have probably killed a lot of bears in recent decades. He even believes PCBs, for example, may have cause changes to the bear’s genes. It’s already been found that thin bears have higher levels of pollutants in their bodies, so some experts fear that hungry bears may be more vulnerable to the effects of chemicals such as PCBs. In 2013, scientists uncovered a worrying trend in 'shrinking' penis bones in otters, possibly caused by chemicals. Experts at Cardiff University and the Chemicals, Health and Environment Monitoring (CHEM) Trust suggested a link between hormone disrupting chemicals and problems with male reproductive health. Experts studying the reproductive health of the mammals in England and Wales were concerned to find a decrease in the weight of otters' penis bones. Other health problems in males included an increase in undescended testicles and cysts on sperm-carrying tubes.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 450lbs white rapper from Antioch, Tennessee, is regretting borrowing his favorite restaurant’s logo for the cover of latest mixtape after Waffle House sent him a cease and desist letter for infringing their copyright. Jason DeFord aka Jelly Roll jokingly describes himself as ‘a regular fat piece of white trash’ and claims to have visited the food chain hundreds of times. Earlier this year, he recorded a 21-track mixtape which he called ‘Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House’, in tribute to three of his favorite things. Waffle House blues: Rapper Jelly Roll has been a loyal customer for years but that didn't stop the company suing him for copyright infringement . He printed up 10,000 copies to give away, with a front cover featuring a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey, a pot leaf and Waffle House’s distinct logo. The back-cover design even looked like the chain’s menu. Unfortunately Waffle House didn’t appreciate the homage and within a month 28-year-old Jelly Roll had received a cease and desist letter from their lawyers. The heavyweight rapper was ordered to destroy everything featuring the company’s name and logo within 10 days for infringing their corporate trademark. Lawyers for the food chain were quick to hit aspiring rapper Jelly Roll with a series of charges after he used their logo on his mixtape cover as a tribute to his favorite eatery . The company also filed a trademark claim that shut him out of his Facebook and YouTube accounts for more than a week. Initially flattered by all the attention from his favorite eatery, it took a visit to a lawyer for Jelly Roll to realize the severity of the situation. The thoughtless homage has left him picking up a very expensive check and he estimates that he’s lost more than $10,000 so far, including scrapping a video shot at a Nashville Waffle House and $500 every time his lawyer communicates with the chain. Yet despite being on the receiving end the company’s strong-arm tactics Jelly Roll confesses that he hasn't been able to stop eating at his local Waffle House. Jelly Roll called his mixtape 'Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House' in tribute to three of his favorite things . ‘I swore I wouldn't tell too many people - I promise you're the only reporter I’ll tell - I just ate at a Waffle House! Even after I vowed I'd never eat at one again, I found myself hungry at an odd hour, under the intoxication of a little whiskey and a little weed, and I wound up in a Waffle House,’ he confessed to Gawker. The incident has brought Jelly Roll a lot of undue stress, but he has gotten through tougher situation in his 28 years including going to prison for drugs possession. The father-of-one has even made able to make light of the situation. ‘I'm 450 pounds - I should have sued Waffle House 10 years ago! Do you know how many All-Star Breakfasts I bought in my life? I might’ve stopped at 330!’ he joked. Weighing in at 450 pounds, Rapper .

"Some 80 locals, described by police as far-right, brawled with 20 young asylum seekers in Bautzen.
The asylum seekers were chased to their hostel and put under police guard.
The mayor said the town had to avoid becoming a playground for the far right. A curfew has been imposed on the young asylum seekers.
Anti-migrant tensions have been mounting in Bautzen this year.
Locals cheered when a building due to house migrants was set on fire in February.
The following month, President Joachim Gauck was verbally abused when he visited Bautzen to discuss the influx of refugees in Germany.
Bautzen and the nearby town of Niedergurig are home to four asylum shelters.
Bautzen is 60km (38 miles) east of Dresden, where the ""anti-Islamisation"" Pegida movement began.
Since the arrival last year of 1.1 million irregular migrants and refugees in Germany, some areas, particularly eastern states, have seen a rise in anti-migrant violence as well as support for the anti-Islam AfD party.
Germany's federal police force says there have been 700 attacks on asylum accommodation this year, including 57 arson attacks.
Each fresh outbreak of refugee-related violence is potentially a political problem for Chancellor Angela Merkel. Some voters say large-scale migration could destabilise German society.
As a result the chancellor's conservative coalition has been haemorrhaging voters to the insurgent anti-migrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.  That's a particular worry given that this weekend voters in Berlin region go to the polls, and next year Mrs Merkel's national government faces re-election.
But many Germans from other parts of Germany are more likely to blame the clashes on racist sentiment, rather than see it as a product of the chancellor's welcoming stance on refugees.
That is because this beautiful area of ex-communist eastern Germany already has a rather ugly reputation for neo-Nazi support and right-wing extremist violence.
Wednesday's outbreak of violence in Bautzen was a dramatic escalation after days of tension in the town.
The clashes appeared to be triggered by an incident the previous evening, when a 32-year-old resident was hurt by a bottle being thrown.
On Wednesday night a group of some 80 people, described by police as right-wingers, shouted slogans at up to 20 young asylum seekers, accusing them of taking over the central Kornmarkt shopping centre.
Tensions escalated, fuelled by alcohol, and scuffles broke out.
Police said they tried to separate the groups and asked them to leave. Then the asylum seekers - all thought to have come to Germany as unaccompanied minors - hurled bottles and wooden sticks at the police, who responded with pepper spray and batons.
When they did disperse, they were pursued by the locals to a nearby asylum centre.
An ambulance crew was caught up in the clashes when far-right residents hurled stones at their vehicle as they tried to take an 18-year-old Moroccan asylum seeker to hospital for treatment.
""It wasn't anarchy, but there was at least a chaotic phase that I would say lasted between 45 and 90 minutes,"" said police chief Uwe Kilz.
Local mayor Alexander Ahrens said he would not tolerate the violence. ""It cannot be that Bautzen turns into a playground for right-wingers spoiling for a fight"".
The young asylum seekers will now face an alcohol ban and a 19:00 curfew.",Residents have clashed with asylum seekers in a town in eastern Germany that has become a flashpoint for anti-refugee sentiment.

"This figure could rise further as police continue their investigation, Assistant Chief Constable of Sussex Police Steve Barry added.
The vintage jet plummeted into traffic on the A27 on Saturday after attempting a loop manoeuvre.
Some victims of the accident have been named by their families.
The number of deaths was initially given as seven, but ACC Barry said it was now ""highly likely"" that 11 had died.
Victims who have been named by their families include Matt Jones, 24, and Worthing United FC footballer Matthew Grimstone, 23.
Another Worthing United footballer, Jacob Schilt, 23, is also believed to be among the victims, his club said.
In a statement, Worthing United FC said Mr Grimstone was their first team goalkeeper and was quiet and reserved, but with a ""huge talent and a brilliant player with huge potential"".
Mr Schilt was a ""tenacious midfielder, a skilful player, with an eye for goal"", the club said.
Sussex Police has said no-one on the airfield was injured but that the pilot - named locally as former RAF pilot Andy Hill - remained in a critical condition in hospital. He was pulled from the burning wreckage.
The status of the jet's ejector seats was yet to be determined, ACC Barry said.
He said the removal of victims' bodies was likely to continue throughout Monday. It was ""quite possible"" more victims would be discovered, he added.
ACC Barry said a crane would be brought in to lift the wreckage of the aircraft on Monday.
The large crash site remains a hazardous area, with fuel still on the plane.
In a video released by Sussex Police, ACC Barry later described the crash as ""devastating"".
He said: ""I've certainly not seen anything like this in my career in terms of the scale, the tragedy and the impact that this is going to have on the local community.
""We are entering the recovery phase of the operation and as we do that we are likely to uncover more fatalities but we are putting in a huge amount of effort in supporting the families and helping them to understand what has happened.""
He appealed to drivers to avoid the area, saying the A27, which was badly damaged during the crash, would be closed for at least another two days.
The crash happened at 13:20 BST on Saturday as the Hawker Hunter jet came out of a loop manoeuvre.
It then smashed into the A27, sending a fireball across the carriageway.
Neil McCarthy, a friend of pilot Andy Hill, told the BBC News Channel that the loop manoeuvre was regarded as ""one of the most dangerous"" to attempt.
He said that ""if you don't have the right entry speed, the right pull back on the stick, the G-force, the right gate height at the top of the loop manoeuvre, it can go wrong pretty quick"".
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is also continuing to investigate the scene alongside the police, who have urged people to think twice before posting ""extremely graphic"" images of the crash online.","Eleven people are now thought to have died after a plane crashed into a West Sussex main road during an air show, police have said."

 Toxic chemicals are accumulating in marine creatures in Earth’s deepest oceanic trenches, the first measurements of organic pollutants in these regions have revealed. 
  
 “We often think deep-sea trenches are remote and pristine, untouched by humans,” says Alan Jamieson, a deep-ocean researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. But Jamieson and his colleagues have found man-made organic pollutants at high levels in shrimp-like crustaceans called amphipods that they collected from two deep-ocean trenches, he told a conference on deep-ocean exploration in Shanghai on 8 June. 
  
 “It’s really surprising to find pollutants so deep in the ocean at such high concentrations,” says Jeffrey Drazen, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. 
  
 Before this work — which has not yet been published — the study of pollutants in deep-sea organisms had been limited to those that live at depths of 2,000 metres or less1, 2. The latest research tested for levels of organic chemicals in amphipods collected at 7,000–10,000 metres depth, from the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean — the world’s deepest trench — and from the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand. 
  
 The creatures were captured during two international expeditions in 2014, when researchers lowered uncrewed landers into the trenches as part of a research programme to study deep-ocean ecosystems, sponsored by the US National Science Foundation. 
  
 Polluted depths 
  
 In both trenches, the amphipods contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — used to make plastics and as anti-fouling agents to stop barnacles growing on ships' hulls — and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are used as flame retardants. 
  
 Both chemicals are man-made and belong to a category of carbon-based compounds called persistent organic pollutants (POPs) because they are hard to break down. Production of PCBs — which are carcinogens — has been banned in many countries since the late 1970s; PBDEs, which animal studies suggest may disrupt hormone systems and interfere with neural development, are only now being phased out. 
  
 The concentrations of PCBs in the amphipods from the Mariana Trench were particularly high, and 15 times greater than those found in the Kermadec. “It’s even higher than in the estuaries of two of the most polluted rivers — the Pearl River and the Liao River — in China,” says Jamieson. 
  
 By contrast, the Kermadec Trench contains PBDEs at concentrations five times greater than the Mariana — and at a level that is higher than in the coastal waters of New Zealand’s North Island, the study finds. 
  
 Douglas Bartlett, a deep-sea microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, says that the discovery is fascinating. “It hits home very dramatically that the trenches are not that remote after all, and the world is all connected,” he says. 
  
 That sinking feeling 
  
 “The take-home message is that when you dump rubbish into the sea, it will ultimately sink. When [pollutants] fall into the trenches, they have nowhere else to go. So they’re just going to keep building up,” says Jamieson. Eventually, the trenches will have higher levels of pollutants than in estuaries, where chemicals are constantly flushed out to open waters, he says. 
  
 The researchers suspect that the proximity of the Mariana Trench to large plastic manufacturers in Asia, as well as to a long-term US military base on the island of Guam, may have contributed to its high PCB levels. The waters above the trench are also part of the North Pacific gyre, a system of strong swirling ocean currents that might be sucking materials on the surface down into the deep sea. Both the Mariana and Kermadec trenches are around 11 kilometres deep. “It sounds quite deep, but it’s not in terms of pollutant transport,” says Jamieson. 
  
 The high POP levels are a cause for concern, researchers say. The deep-ocean canyons are “untapped natural resources” — a potential supply of organisms that could be valuable for a range of commercial applications, including drug discovery, but which might be affected by the pollutants, says Drazen. 
  
 Scientists think that deep-ocean trenches could also be an important carbon sink, playing a key part in regulating climate, Bartlett says. In part, that is because in the trenches, carbon is pushed deep into Earth's interior when one tectonic plate is thrust underneath another. The trenches are also teeming with microbes that may convert carbon-containing chemicals into forms that aren’t easily converted into carbon dioxide. 
  
 “If somehow microbial activities are adversely affected because of all this pollution, I’d wonder what that’s doing to the carbon cycle in general,” says Bartlett. ||||| World Amphipoda Database

 Introduction 
  
 The amphipods belong to the very diverse crustacean class Malacostraca, which includes other common groups such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp. The order Amphipoda is part of the superorder Peracarida, uniting a diverse group of small shrimp-like taxa that brood their young in a pouch, with no independent larval dispersal stage. 
  
 Amphipods are unique in the possession of three pairs of pleopods and three pairs of uropods. In a small minority of cases secondary reduction of the abdomen may result in a loss of one or more pairs (e.g. the Caprellidae). No other malacostracan group possesses more than one pair of uropods. The name Amphipoda means ‘different feet’ and refers to the different forms of the pereopods (legs) which contrasts with the related Isopoda meaning ‘same feet’. Amphipods are variously known as, scuds, shrimp or sideswimmers. Those amphipods that have colonised the land are often referred to as landhoppers and beach dwellers are called sandhoppers or beach/sand fleas. 
  
 The order Amphipoda is very diverse and currently contains 10,207 species which are divided into six suborders: 
  
 Suborder Amphilochidea (88 families; 682 genera; 4,140 species) 
  
 Suborder Colomastigidea (2 families; 3 genera; 55 species) 
  
 Suborder Hyperiidea (35 families; 76 genera; 283 species) 
  
 Suborder Hyperiopsidea (3 families; 4 genera; 13 species) 
  
 Suborder Pseudingolfiellidea (1 families; 1 genera; 4 species) 
  
 Suborder Senticaudata (99 families; 907 genera; 5,638 species) 
  
 Amphipods range in size from a millimetre in length to the supergiant amphipod Alicella gigantea at 340 mm. Amphipods can be found in all marine habitats (even the deepest ocean trenches e.g. Hirondellea dubia), and have also colonised freshwaters and terrestrial habitats; even ectoparasitic groups are also known among them. There are at least 1870 amphipod species and subspecies recorded from fresh or inland waters accounting for ~ 20 % of the total known amphipod diversity. Amphipods are important herbivores, detritivores, micropredators and scavengers in most environments and they form an important component of marine and freshwater ecosystems. 
  
 History of the database 
  
 The World Amphipoda Database arose from a merger in 2010 of the World Amphipoda List compiled over many years by Jim Lowry (Australian Museum), with the European Register of Marine Species (ERMS) amphipod list, compiled by Mark Costello with the help of Denise Bellan-Santini and Jean-Claude Dauvin, and edited up until 2013 with significant additions from the RAMS Amphipoda (Antarctic) list (compiled by Claude De Broyer) and from other regional editors. 
  
 The original editors of Amphipoda within WoRMS were Mark Costello, Denise Bellan-Santini, Jean Claude-Dauvin, & Wim Vader, with Claude de Broyer as Editor of the Register of Antarctic Marine Species (RAMS) Amphipoda. The north-Atlantic lists were compiled by Mark Costello with assistance from Louise Collier, from Costello et al. (1989), Brattegard (1997) and Vader et al (1997). The Mediterranean and south Atlantic lists were compiled from Bellan-Santini et al. (1998), Marques and Bellan-Santini (1990, 1991), and Lopes et al. (1993). Additional species were then found in Dauvin (1999), and for Arctic seas, in Palerud and Vader (1991) and Vader (1998). Jim Lowry’s unpublished list was added to WoRMS in 2010 when he became editor of the Amphipoda. To provide sufficient expert knowledge for maintaining the database, we have now (2013) formed an editorial team to whom the queries on particular taxa should be addressed.

A research team out of Scotland's University of Aberdeen has discovered high concentrations of human-created organic pollutants in crustaceans gathered from two deep-ocean trenches, putting to rest any hope that people haven't managed to muck up even the world's most far-flung locations. ""We often think deep-sea trenches are remote and pristine, untouched by humans,"" lead researcher Alan Jamieson tells Nature, which notes he delivered his announcement about the find at a deep-sea exploration conference in China on June 8 and that the research has yet to be published. The work involved scientists lowering two unpeopled landers about 6 miles deep in 2014: one into the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, and the other into the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand. They then tested the amphipods—tiny crustaceans that resemble shrimp—they found down there and discovered the creatures had polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), both hard-to-break down, carbon-based compounds used to make plastics and as flame retardants. The PCB concentration in Mariana Trench amphipods was especially stunning—15 times that of the crustaceans in the Kermadec. Researchers believe the high PCB levels may be due to the Mariana Trench's relative closeness to Asian plastic manufacturers. ""The take-home message is that when you dump rubbish into the sea, it will ultimately sink,"" Jameieson says. ""When [pollutants] fall into the trenches, they have nowhere else to go. So they’re just going to keep building up."" (Plastic is also floating around the ocean via human feces.)"
"Mr Muslem was a recent graduate in English literature; Shireen was still studying.
But four months after their wedding, their lives were shattered when so-called Islamic State (IS) fighters overran their city, forcing almost all of its civilians to flee into Turkey.
Now the couple and their 20-month old son Mirwan live more than 2,300 miles (3,700km) away in Colwyn Bay, Conwy county.
After more than two years in a refugee camp in northern Iraq, they are relieved to finally have a safe, long-term home.
""When IS attacked in 2014, everything was destroyed,"" Mr Muslem, 29, said.
""Everyone left. We moved to Turkey and then to Iraq but some people returned to the city. Then IS attacked another time and we lost abut 500 people. They were all killed.
""Every family in Syria has lost one person in the family. I lost my brother two years ago and we don't know if he is alive or dead. Some people have lost all their family.""
""It was so hard,"" Mrs Muslem, 28, added. ""We had to leave our town because of the war and all the destruction. We were afraid for our lives and we had to go. It was a bad situation.""
""Here, I feel very happy and settled, the people are very kind and when we need anything, they help us.""
Until the family arrived in north Wales, Mirwan had lived all his young life in the Gawilan refugee camp in northern Iraq.
""I delivered him in the camp,"" Mrs Muslem said. ""It was difficult because the weather is very hot and it was summer when I had him. I was afraid I'd lose him.
""There is only a small medical surgery at the camp and most of the time there is no medicine and the service is very simple.""
""I saw many, many bad situations when we first left Syria,"" Mr Muslem said. ""We didn't want to live in a tent but where would we go? There was no choice for us.
""We couldn't go to rent a house in another city so we stayed in the camp and lived in a tent.""
Since Kurdish forces drove IS out of Kobane in June 2015, some people have returned to the city - among them, relatives of the couple.
""I have two sisters in Syria,"" Mrs Muslem said. ""They moved back after the fighting ended. I worry about them so much and want them to come and live in the UK too but it's very difficult.""
Mr Muslem has two sisters in the refugee camp and family in Kobane.
""Their life is OK now but it's temporary,"" he said. ""Maybe war will come again, we don't know what's going to happen in Syria.""
By the end of February 2017, at least 397 refugees had been resettled in Wales under the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.
Mr and Mrs Muslem and Mirvan are the first to be placed in Conwy.
""I didn't know where I was going,"" Mr Muslem said. ""I was just told in Iraq, you will go to Manchester airport and you will live in Conwy.
""When we arrived, we saw it was a good town. The weather is good and it's very nice for tourism. There are nice places like Llandudno and Rhyl and Bangor - I've visited all of these cities.""
Life was lonely at first but after three months, the family is starting to make new friends.
""When I arrived here, I didn't know anyone,"" Mr Muslem said. ""I had one friend but the council helped me meet people.
""I know some more people now - I hope to meet many more but I know I have some friends.
""For me it's not difficult but for other people it could be because they don't know the language and if they can't speak the language, they can't meet people.""
He is perfecting his English at a college course in Bangor and wants to qualify as a teacher.
""If I go back to Syria after five years, I will help my own people in the university or in high school,"" he said.
For now though, the family is staying put in Wales to rebuild the burgeoning life that was wrecked nearly three years ago by war.","In the spring of 2014, newlyweds Omer and Shireen Muslem were starting a new life together in their hometown of Kobane, northern Syria."
"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's armed forces have a new look after President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi ordered major changes to both the military's leadership and structure on Wednesday. The expansive reshuffle appears to have removed those loyal to Yemen's previous President Ali Abdullah Saleh from their powerful positions within the military, with several other generals attaining appointments to new positions. As part of the restructuring, the elite republican guard and the first armored division will be absorbed into the country's Defense Ministry. The republican guard has been led by Saleh's eldest son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, and Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who defected during the 2011 Yemeni uprising, has commanded the first armored division. ""General Ahmed Ali and Ali Mohsen are a headache for millions of Yemenis dreaming of a better country and a real national military,"" Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni youth activist, told CNN. ""It's a good step, but it should have been done a long time ago ... It won't happen overnight,"" added Al-Muslimi. ""It will need a few years for this to work out."" Amnesty details 'horrific abuses' in southern Yemen . ""Yemen will head in the right direction with this restructuring of the armed forces and the ending of the contentious divisions in the military,"" said a Yemeni government official who was not authorized to speak to the media. Yemen's military will now consist of five branches: Land Forces, Air Forces, Navy and Coastal Defense Forces, Border Guard, and the Strategic Reserve Forces, according to a news release from the Yemeni embassy in Washington. The Land Forces command will oversee seven regional commands, and the Strategic Reserve Forces will include the recently established presidential protective brigades, the new missile defense command and the new special operations command, the release said. A top presidential aide told CNN that the restructuring needed to take place quickly if Yemen was to go forward. ""We are working towards a unified army under a unified leadership, and this needs to take place now,"" the presidential aide said, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue. The changes came as protests continued in front of Hadi's residence. Demonstrators said they wouldn't participate in the upcoming National Dialogue Conference unless Saleh's relatives and loyalists who hold key military and security posts are removed. Yemeni officials have been hoping all the political factions in the country would meet at the conference. President of Yemen visits White House . Youth activists celebrated in Change Square on Wednesday, calling the latest decrees a clear victory for reformists and those seeking democracy. ""We support these decisive military decisions, and a major part of our demands have finally been accepted,"" said Khaled al-Anesi, a leading activist among the first to publicly call for restructuring the military. ""After the removal of Saleh aides, we will seek justice for those who were killed by the previous regime,"" he added. Hadi took power in February as part of a Gulf Cooperation Council-backed deal that forced Saleh to trade his position for immunity after a year of political unrest destabilized the country. A United Nations envoy remains in Yemen to help with the transition.

"Three astronauts successfully reached the International Space Station this morning, where their six-month mission will include taking the Olympic torch on its first spacewalk.

Before that passing milestone however, Hopkins, Kotov and Ryazanskiy face more immediate problems. The skeleton crew they are reinforcing was to have overseen the arrival of a commercial cargo ship carrying vital food supplies to the station this week. But a software problem left the unmanned Cygnus freighter unable to receive navigation data properly from the station, delaying the arrival of its 1,300lbs of food and clothes until no earlier than Saturday.

The Cygnus cargo . ship, built and launched by Orbital Sciences with backing from NASA, . blasted off aboard an Antares rocket on September 18 from a new launch . pad on the Virginia coast. Orbital . Sciences said the two orbiting vessels established direct contact early . on Sunday, but the Cygnus rejected some of the data, which interrupted . the entire rendezvous. The problem was traced to a difference in data format in the navigation systems of the two spacecraft, the company said.

Hopkins, pictured left before the launch, told his mother after arriving at the space station that the journey there 'was a pretty good ride'. Left, the intrepid trio wave as they climb the steps into the Soyuz module . Despite the restocking problems, new arrival Hopkins was upbeat about his mission. During a prelaunch press conference on Tuesday he said: 'As a crew we're very excited to be up there when Cygnus rendezvous and docks and (we're) looking forward to opening that hatch.' He and Ryazanskiy are space rookies making their first flights. Kotov, who will take over command of the station when his compatriot Yurchikhin leaves in November, has made two previous long-duration missions on the station. During their five-month stay, Kotov and Ryazanskiy are scheduled to make three spacewalks, the first of which will include taking the unlit Olympic torch outside the airlock. 'Our goal here is to make it look spectacular,' Kotov, speaking through a translator, told reporters. Kotov added: 'We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work.' The torch is scheduled to be delivered to the station on Nov. 6 by the next crew launching to the outpost. Yurchikhin, Nyberg and Parmitano will then bring it back to Earth when they return home four days later so the traditional torch relay can continue. 'Unfortunately we cannot light it in space so we will simply take it to space and take pictures and some video with the station and the Earth in the background,' Ryazanskiy said in a prelaunch NASA interview.

"A couple that had been married for 69 years will now get the chance to spend eternity together. Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna of Stamford, Connecticut had a fairy tale romance, falling in love in Rome and getting married shortly before the end World War II, later having four children. They moved to Stamford in the 60s and, tragically, 91-year-old Giuseppe passed away on Saturday. So in love: Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna, who met in Rome and were married for 69 years . Eternal love: After Giuseppe passed away on Saturday, Livia died less than an hour later . Something shocking happened shortly after however, when his bride of 69 years, Livia, passed away less than an hour later. They had both been living together at the Smith House Health Care Center. It was from a 'broken heart' her family members told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'My mother was in shock to hear that my father had just died. She couldn't breathe and she was having a fit, even though she was on oxygen,' said Giuliana DiGeronimo, the couple's daughter. 'At the nursing home, everyone said they were angels. Everybody used to say how much they loved each other and how my father was always trying to help my mother.' The couple's other daughter, Angela Munzenmaier, was actually on the phone with her mother when her father died, and had to deliver the horrible news. Li9felong love: Family members say Livia died of a 'broken heart' 'I told her she needed to be strong and that my dad had passed away. She started screaming his name and didn't want to talk and hung up the phone,' Munzenmaier said. Soon after, her brother got the call that their mother too had passed. 'They yelled and screamed at each other almost every day, but I think it was because they liked making up so much,' Munzenmaier said. 'My mom was feisty.

"They say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by. So it should come as no surprise then that, like his master, Larry the Downing Street cat is himself fond of a little ‘chillaxing’ now and then. And on a day when Britain basked in the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching a sizzling 27c (81f), who could blame him. Taking it easy: Larry the Downing Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now . Stretched out in the Midday sun the brown and white tabby slumped down on his side and took a well-deserved cat nap just a few feet from the door of Number 10. Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, was given the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet and was chosen by Downing Street staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year. But since his arrival he appears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill ratio Larry has become better known for his...sleeping. He may not have to worry about the eurozone crisis or hauling Britain out of recession, but that didn't stop Larry seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun yesterday. Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Is David Cameron too 'chillaxed' to run the country? Now share your opinion . David Cameron attracted some criticism for his own 'chillaxing' last week following claims in a biography that he spends weekends at Chequers singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch. His latest afternoon snooze came as Britain baked. After the wettest April on record and perhaps the coldest start to May in 70 years the mercury is finally beginning to move in the right direction. Sunseekers poured onto the country’s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing. Creature comforts: Larry, pictured last year, appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as any other feline . Those at the Chelsea Flower Show were left wilting whilst one man and his dinghy floated out to sea in South Devon sparking a major rescue operation. Incredibly Britain was hotter than parts of Australia, South America, Africa and the Middle East. It also left most of the Mediterranean in the shade. And the temperature is expected to rise even further today (thurs). Forecasters said it could reach up to 28c (xxf) in the south and south east - and best of all, the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘It is bikini and ice cream weather for almost the whole country. Distracted: The preoccupied Prime Minister attracted criticism for his supposed 'chillaxing' style when pictured watching the end of the Champions League final . Running talks: Earlier in this week's G8 summit talks at Camp David, Mr Cameron and President Obama staged a 35-minute 'treadmill summit' side by side at the gym . ‘Pretty much everywhere has temperatures in the 20s Celsius and wall-to-wall sunshine. ‘In recent weeks we had low pressure over or close to the UK, bringing rain and cold temperatures. ‘Over the last couple of days, that has given way to high pressure, sunny weather and rising temperatures from the Continent.’ At 26.9c (80.4f) yesterday (wed) was the hottest day of the year, but it is expected to get even hotter today (thurs). It will be 28c and sunny in London. Summer sun: Larry's sunbathing session came as the rest of the UK enjoyed a gloriously hot May, including here in Aviemore, Scotland, where temperatures reached 26.9C . Basking: Rhianna Mallia, 18, and Louise Dougherty, 21, were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in Aviemore, which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the UK yesterday . Bizarrely, the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the Scottish ski resort of Aviemore. It also hit 26.9c (80.4f) at London’s Heathrow Airport, 25.9c (78.6f) on Bournemouth’s beaches and 25.6c (78.1f) in London’s St James’s Park. Supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages, burgers and summer tipple Pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies. Five million sausages - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave. Not the only one: Larry the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday, including angler Arthur Cansfield in the Lake District . Asda also predicts it will sell one million burgers, half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales. Chris Carden, Asda’s head of fresh food supply, said: ‘We have already seen rising sales throughout the week of typical BBQ fare such as burgers and sausages but with the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend, we’re expecting it to be one of the biggest we’ve ever seen for barbecue foods.’ Only days ago the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time of year. Ironically, the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hosepipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on April 5 after months of drought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month. Meanwhile, the arrival of the sun saw betting firm Ladbrokes slash the odds of the temperature soaring past 39c (103f) during the Jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘It finally looks like summer has arrived, and the odds suggest the Jubilee weekend could be a scorcher.’","Downing St pet shows same knack for down time as his 'chillaxing' master .

""She just went for every shot and hit it deep, and I came under pressure straightaway,"" Wozniacki added. ""I thought I served well, though. In the second set I think I had my chances, and I probably should have taken them but I didn't. ""You never know what could have happened in the third set but there was still a long way to go.

Meanwhile, World No.7 Errani defeated her doubles partner Robert Vinci 6-3 6-3 following an hour and 23 minute battle. ""It's tough to play against one person who knows what you're going to do with every shot,"" she told the WTA website. Errani will go into the final as favorite having won each of her three previous meetings against Kvitova without dropping a set. But Kvitova believes she has every chance of springing a surprise Saturday. ""We've played a few times, but she's a Top 10 player,"" she added. ""She has a good forehand with big spin and is quite fast on the backhand. ""She moves very well, too.

It's usually a peaceful, very English county town - but tonight Lewes in East Sussex is aflame with its annual Bonfire Night celebrations. Tens of thousands lined the streets in the small market town to watch the fiery procession, which traces its roots to the 16th century reign of Mary I and the Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot of 1605. It is just one of many November 5 gatherings up and down the country, with the night sky illuminated by colourful pyrotechnics. While some will strike lucky with the weather, others won't be so fortunate as their fireworks displays are spoilt by torrential rain. Temperatures are expected to plummet close to freezing, making this the coldest Bonfire Night in 14 years. Scroll down for video . March of the flaming crosses: Lewes residents lined the streets in their hundreds to watch the procession of 17 flaming crosses to represent the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town in the 16th century . Spectacular show: Participants in the parade hold flaming torches to light up the chilly night air. Forecasters said tonight will be the coldest November 5 for over a decade . Religious connection: The flame procession in Lewes has its roots in the 16th century. In previous years, 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches . All ages: Young participants in the festivities, which also link to the infamous Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot against the Houses of Parliament in 1605 . Step back in time: The shops and buildings on the main streets of Lewes may have changed, but this is one annual tradition that holds strong . Showpiece: Crowds and marchers gathered around the Lewes war memorial to light crosses. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up Parliament, is also burnt . The procession, organised annually by six local societies, traces its roots to the 16th century and marks a tumultuous time in English history. A key part of the parade is seventeen flaming crosses, one for each of the Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 as part of the Marian Prosecutions. The purge was initiated by the Roman Catholic monarch Queen Mary, who reigned between 1553 and 1558, and passed strict anti-Protestant legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the Pope. Smoky: This marcher seemed to be creating his own trail of thick red smoke as he made his way through the streets of Lewes . Ritual: Crowds cluster round as dozens of marchers with burning torches perform a ceremony . Burn him! The effigy of Guy Fawkes is carried through the streets to be set alight . Spooky: Halloween may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade . At least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung, drawn and quartered. It is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000. An effigy of Guy Fawkes, who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament with Gunpowder. The Lewes event has previously courted controversy - in 2001, an effigy of Osama Bin Laden attracted national attention, as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan. A fiery history: The seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in Lewes as part of the Marian persecutions against Protestants in the reign of Mary I . History lesson: The Lewes Bonfire Night celebrations mark, in part, the Marian Persecutions of 1555-1557, a purge of Protestant religious reformers during the reign of Roman Catholic monarch Mary I. Heresy against the Catholic faith was punishable by death, with some burnt at the stake, as in Lewes, and other hung, drawn and quartered . While the flames remained alight in Lewes, others in the country saw their Bonfire Night pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain. A number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding in Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire the worst affected. It follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend, including one in Newham, East London and in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. In all, the Environment Agency issued seven flood warning in England and Wales on Monday morning, covering areas of the South-West, South-East, East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales.There were also 53 flood alerts in operation .In Carmarthenshire, nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on Sunday evening.

"(CNN)  -- Bordeaux clinched the French league title with a 1-0 win over Caen on a dramatic final day of the season. Bordeaux's fans celebrate their first French league title in 10 years. Laurent Blanc's men were ending Lyon's seven-year hold on the domestic championship and winning Bordeaux's first title in 10 years. A goal from Yoan Gouffran early in the second half secured their 11th straight win and their second trophy of the season having won the French League Cup in April. The defeat saw Caen drop to the second flight and kept Bordeaux three points clear of second-placed Marseille who won 4-0 at home to Rennes to keep up the pressure to the last.

"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A large shark was killed off the west Australian coast on Sunday, the first under a contentious new state government culling policy aimed at curbing fatal shark attacks. 
  
 The Western Australia government on Saturday began placing baited hooks on drum lines off popular beaches in the state capital Perth and to the south to kill white, bull and tiger sharks over three meters (10 feet) long. 
  
 The policy is a response to seven fatal shark attacks in Australia's southwest in three years. 
  
 Government spokesman Simon Beaumont said the first shark was killed by a government-contracted commercial fisherman on Sunday morning off Castle Rock near the town of Dunsborough, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Perth. 
  
 The shark was longer than three meters (10 feet) and was one of the three targeted species. Beaumont would not say which of the three species it was. 
  
 Once the fisherman had confirmed with fishing authorities that the shark was the required species and size, he shot it and dumped the carcass at sea, Beaumont said. 
  
 The policy has divided the community since it was announced several weeks ago and led to thousands of people demonstrating on Perth beaches against the shark cull. 
  
 Activists have threatened to sabotage the drum lines and threatened one fisherman who had accepted a government contract to catch sharks off Perth. He pulled out, citing the threats. 
  
 The federal government last week gave state authorities a special exemption from environmental laws to kill white sharks, a protected species. 
  
 Environmentalists argue that there is no evidence that the cull will reduce shark attacks. They argue it could even increase the shark danger by giving water users a false sense of security. 
  
 ""To think that we're wasting this opportunity to tag and to find out more about these creatures, that we're just going to slaughter them and dump them — it's just such a waste of life,"" Rae Threnoworth, member of marine conservation group Sea Shepherd, told Ten Network television. 
  
 State Premier Colin Barnett was heckled by members of the public over the shark's death as he officiated at a citizenship ceremony in Perth on Sunday. 
  
 ""I get no pleasure out of seeing sharks killed,"" Barnett told reporters. ""But I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia. That's what I'm doing."" ||||| The first shark is caught under the drum line policy. Pictures: Sharon Smith/The West Australian 
  
 Premier Colin Barnett says he gets no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but his responsibility as Premier was the safety of beachgoers. 
  
 Speaking today after the first shark was caught and kill under the State Government's drum line policy, Mr Barnett said he was pleased the shark mitigation plan was underway and that it would reduce the risk to beachgoers. 
  
 The shark, which appeared to be a 3m tiger shark, was pulled from the water shortly after 7am on a drum-line off Meelup Beach near Dunsborough. 
  
 It was shot in the head up to four times at close range. 
  
 Yesterday afternoon, amid pressure from the Government for the policy to come into force in time for the Australia Day long weekend, several lines were set either side of Dunsborough. 
  
 Despite fierce opposition and repeated claims of ""direct action"", environmental activists have not intervened. 
  
 The shark has been dumped off Cape Naturaliste. 
  
 The first of the baited hooks was set around Old Dunsborough beach at 2.25pm yesterday. 
  
 Mr Barnett said he was not surprised how quickly a shark was caught under the new shark mitigation plan. 
  
 “There are a lot of sharks down there,” he said. 
  
 “Anecdotal evidence is sufficiently strong that there has been a significant increase in the shark population and even more aggressive behaviour by sharks. 
  
 “Until we can provide that protection and safety, the program will continue on."" 
  
 Mr Barnett was heckled at a citizenship ceremony this morning where a person in the crowd yelled that ""what you're doing with the sharks is wrong"". 
  
 He appeared undeterred by recent protests about the shark policy. 
  
 “I respect and acknowledge and people have different points of view and there are protestors, but my responsibility as Premier is the safety of beachgoers,” he said. 
  
 “I get no pleasure at seeing sharks killed but I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia and that’s what I’m doing.” 
  
 “When you have sharks of three, four, five metres long of known aggressive varieties, swimming in the water very close to beachgoers, that is imminent danger and reluctantly I have had to take that decision.” 
  
 Under the policy, baited drum lines are to be set 1km off the coast in Perth and the South West to catch great white, tiger and bull sharks bigger than 3m in length.

 Sea Shepherd's Jeff Hansen said the shark was “believed to be a beautiful tiger shark” more than three metres long. 
  
 The fisherman contracted to catch and kill in the South West will also lay the lines at beaches in Meelup, Castle Rock and Gracetown. 
  
 Earlier yesterday, a document appeared on the Department of Transport website implying metropolitan drum lines would also be in place by Monday.

 ""Mariners are advised that a number of Government of Western Australia shark drum lines have been deployed within 1km offshore of the following metropolitan and regional areas and will remain in place until April 30,” it said. 
  
 The notice, due to be published in The West Australian on Monday, has since been changed. 
  
 A spokesman acknowledged the error and said the wording had been corrected to include the words “will soon be deployed in the metropolitan region”. 
  
 ""The fact remains, baited drum lines will be placed at popular metropolitan beaches as soon as possible, and mariners need to be advised there are exclusion zones around these deployments,” he said. 
  
 Picture: Rob Scott/7 News 
  
 Labor spokeswoman Sue Ellery said it was another example of the Government botching the implementation of the policy. 
  
 “All they have done today is confuse mariners with the notice on the Department of Transport website,” she said. 
  
 “If the lines are eventually ever actually dropped in the metropolitan area, how will metro boat users know which notice to believe?” 
  
 Conservationists are reportedly in Dunsborough today and are preparing to free any animals that are caught by the drum lines. 
  
 It is believed about 20 people from conservation group Animal Rescue Team are in the area with scuba diving equipment and an inflatable boat. 
  
 The Government yesterday announced the shark barrier designed to protect beachgoers at Old Dunsborough beach had been completed. 
  
 The $165,000 barrier, based on those used on the Gold Coast to prevent bull shark attacks, has been built as part of the City of Busselton’s beach enclosure trial. 
  
 The enclosure has six metal piles drilled into the seabed supporting a 100m x 300m mesh barrier. |||||","– The first shark has been killed off Western Australia under a controversial new policy aimed at protecting swimmers from attacks.

"The allegations came to light after Scott Rogers, 52, a former dance academy teacher in Suffolk, was shot at his home in Iberville, Louisiana.
Two British men have told a US radio station they were abused by Mr Rogers.
Computers and mobile phones have been seized from Mr Rogers' house as part of the investigation into his death.
The Iberville sheriff's office said the WAFB-TV presenter was thought to have been shot by former lover Mathew Hodgkinson - also his son-in-law - who they believe then shot himself in the head.
Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmie, remains in hospital in an induced coma but has started to show signs of life.
On Tuesday he was seen to move and deputies are confident he has brain activity, reports WBRZ News 2.
Following Mr Rogers' death, two men gave an interview with the Jim Engster Radio Show on WRKF in Baton Rouge alleging they were repeatedly sexually abused by the dance teacher as children.
One said he was aware of allegations made against Mr Rogers by the age of 12 and said he began becoming ""intimate"" with him when he was 13.
""The truth is... when I met that man I was 12 years old... he was introducing concepts like love to me, through sex he was informing my understanding of physical intimacy,"" the man said.
""He would guide me in how to speak to my parents on what to say to people.
The man said he heard about Mr Rogers' death while waiting to testify before a grand jury over information supplied to the US authorities by the TV host.
Mr Rogers is thought to have failed to declare the fact he had been arrested in the UK when applying to become a foster parent in the US.
A second British man told the radio show that Mr Rogers was ""a master manipulator, an expert at brainwashing"".
He said: ""He is the worst predatory paedophile that you could imagine and when you are a child and you are faced with that type of monster with that type of intelligent mind, you don't stand a chance.""
Sheriff Brett Stassi, of Iberville police, told the BBC: ""My concern is just with the murder-suicide at this time.
""If some of these computers or phones open up to some child pornography or something we'll go in that direction - but we have no evidence of that as this time.
""All I can say is the life he left in the UK was among a conversation of sexual abuse - but not here.
""It was only before the continued custody hearing we heard for the first time why he left the UK.""
The abuse is alleged to have happened in the UK in the early 1990s.
Mr Rogers, then 28, was arrested by Suffolk Police following an allegation of sexual assault against a 13-year-old boy in June 1991 at the Bury St Edmunds Academy of Dance, Suffolk Police said.
In May 1992, he was charged with a number of sex offences and in June 1993 stood trial at the Inner London Crown Court, where a jury failed to reach a verdict.
The judge discharged the jury and no retrial took place, meaning Mr Rogers was acquitted.
He left the UK in the mid-1990s after an arts academy he founded in Bury St Edmunds was likened to a ""cult"".
In 1995, BBC Look East reported that Suffolk County Council had ""taken the unusual step"" of issuing a warning to parents about the Academy of Dance and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds.
There were claims of an ""unhealthy atmosphere"" similar to ""a religious or supposedly religious cult"" at the school founded by Mr Rogers, the East Anglian Daily Times has reported.
A Suffolk County Council spokeswoman said the council ""was made aware before the fatal incident that services in Baton Rouge were investigating Richard Scott Rogers"".
""Suffolk County Council and Suffolk Police are supporting and assisting those services,"" she said.
""We will be keeping this matter under review and if anyone would like to make contact about this case you can do by calling Suffolk Police.""","A US TV host who is thought to have been murdered by his ex-lover was a ""monster"" who sexually abused boys, it has been claimed."
"This week, the U.S. Navy forsook a tradition dating back to the 1800s. Why? Because it's now too easily confused with the musings of an Internet lunatic. Naval commanders this week announced that they would be getting rid of a rule that all official communications should be in all-caps. It's a tradition dating to the 1850s, when the military used teletype machines that didn't have lowercase letters. The change is meant to simplify communication and is supposed to save the Navy $15 million because it can get rid of a dedicated messaging service and use regular old e-mail instead. But we have to think not wanting to sound like you're shouting at someone who SAID SOMETHING WRONG ON THE INTERNET played a role, too. The most gentle message can come across as psychotically aggressive when typed in all caps. So as the Navy transitions, we decided to round up five of our favorite examples of all-cap craziness. The Kanye mea culpa . Perhaps it's not a rant, as such. (Though he's certainly been no stranger to them). But we had to go with the time Kanye West slammed down the caps lock to apologize, on his blog, for his infamous stage-bombing of Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards. ""I'M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM. I SPOKE TO HER MOTHER RIGHT AFTER AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING MY MOTHER WOULD'VE SAID. SHE IS VERY TALENTED! I LIKE THE LYRICS ABOUT BEING A CHEERLEADER AND SHE'S IN THE BLEACHERS! ........................ I'M IN THE WRONG FOR GOING ON STAGE AND TAKING AWAY FROM HER MOMENT!................."" Of course, in the grand tradition of half-apologies, he spends several of his remaining loud sentences justifying the moment he interrupted Swift's acceptance speech to say that Beyonce should have won instead of her. ""BEYONCE'S VIDEO WAS THE BEST OF THIS DECADE!!!! I... WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD!!!! EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I'M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE!!! ... I'M STILL HAPPY FOR TAYLOR!!!! BOOOYAAAWWWW!!!! YOU ARE VERY VERY TALENTED!!! ...  I'M NOT CRAZY YALL, I'M JUST REAL."" Gotcha. The Bakery flame-out . Having your restaurant appear on ""Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" is bad enough. Having the host quit on you because you're too hard to work with is even worse. Flaming out about it on Facebook in a series of profanity-laced all-caps outbursts? Priceless. Amy's Baking Company, in Scottsdale, Arizona, experienced just that last month after appearing on the show with the famously acerbic chef. So, after the show aired, the smart thing to do would be to take to social media to calmly explain how your restaurant was misrepresented, right? Or, you can try this: . ""WE DO NOT NEED THIS. YOU STUPID PEOPLE. ... DO NOT BLAME US BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT AFFORD QUALITY. THE YELPERS, AND NOW THE REDDITS, NEED TO BACK OFF. YOURE NOT RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME TV SHOW."" A Facebook freakout? Wrong you are, apparently: . ""WE ARE NOT FREAKING OUT WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT A 'WITCH HUNT' I AM NOT A WITCH. I AM GODS CHILD. P--- OFF ALL OF YOU. F--- REDDITS, F--- YELP AND F--- ALL OF YOU. BRING IT. WE WILL FIGHT BACK."" Believe us when we tell you they were just getting started. Things got so bad that Amy's has since created a new Facebook page. Nearly a month later, let's just say that it's still not polite coffee talk. The Comic Sans LeBron slam . Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's 2010 open letter to fans after LeBron James left the team for the shores of South Beach is mainly remembered for another typographical choice. His fiery screed was typed in Comic Sans -- an Internet-reviled font that is sort of hard to read without giggling. But it was the single sentence he decided to go all-caps with that makes this list: . ""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE"" As you NBA fans may have noted, James already has one title under his belt with the Miami Heat and he's currently in the finals playing for number two. The Cavs? Still waiting. I'll tweet you, babe . OK, Cher, we get it. Donald Trump rubs a lot of people the wrong way. From the tone-deaf self-promotion to the strident political views, Mr. Apprentice has mixed it up with everyone from irreverent sports blog Deadspin to CNN's own Wolf Blitzer. So when the pop-music icon caught on to an effort to boycott Trump's line of neckties, she was so worked up she had to do it in all-caps. ""I'll NEVER GO TO MACY'S AGAIN! I didn't know they sold Donald Trump's Line! If they don't care that they sell products from a LOUDMOUTH,"" Cher wrote on Twitter. Then:  ""RACIST CRETIN,WHO'D LIE LIKE 'HIS RUG' TO GET SOME CHEAP PRESS! I CANT BELIEVE MACY'S THINKS HE'S THE RIGHT 'MAN' 2 REPRESENT THEIR NAME!"" Say what you will about The Donald. At least he didn't resort to all-caps in his response. ""@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!"" Trump wrote. We didn't say it was classy. Just that it wasn't in all-caps. Drunk Hulk Is drunk . OK, we didn't say they were the worst all-caps rants. Just the top ones. And it's hard to top an enormous green rage monster who has knocked back a few too many. Twitter's Drunk Hulk, one of our favorite parody accounts, tweets sort of exactly like you'd imagine a witty, pre-intervention Hulk would tackle the topics of the day. On government surveillance: ""IT GREAT GOVERNMENT RECORD EVERY PHONE CALL! NOW DRUNK HULK FIND OUT WHAT WAS SAID WHEN DRUNK HULK CALL YOU LAST NIGHT!"" On really sad fantasy epics: ""GAME OF THRONES! GO TO YOUR ROOM! AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DONE!"" On a Billy Joel classic: ""IF YOU SEE MAN MAKING LOVE TO TONIC AND GIN AT BAR! NO SING SONG ABOUT IT! CALL POLICE IMMEDIATELY!"" His whole Twitter feed is an all-caps rant. And we're not going to tell him to stop, are you? What did we miss? Let us know about some of your favorite rants in the comments.","The U.S. Navy has announced it will no longer communicate in all-caps .

"(CNN) -- Sheryl Sandberg wants young girls to ""ban bossy,"" but for those of us soon-to-graduate, just-graduated and will-I-ever-graduate ladies just entering the working world, there's another word that's even more toxic. That word is ""pushy."" At least, that's what my Lean In Circle thinks. A new book by Sandberg, ""Lean In: For Graduates,"" targets women like us, but we were already paying attention. My Circle is all 20-somethings with dreams of media industry success. We wanted our group to exist as a third-wave feminist answer to boys clubs, with their oak-paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke. We share job announcements, work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks. A guy recently asked me, ""Lean In Circle -- is that, like, a book club?"" Sort of. Not quite. According to Sandberg's Lean In Foundation, 14,000 Lean In Circles meet regularly around the globe, and we don't just reread ""Lean In"" over mimosas. Lean In Circles were conceived as ""small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust."" The Washington Post described the ethos as ""Alcoholics Anonymous fused with Girl Scouts,"" and I have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular Circle environment. And so we formed, and rallied around our Circle mission: to sit at the table and push back against ""pushy"" to find our first jobs. 'Wait your turn' My mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice: Wait your turn, don't be pushy. But when I was 22, still in college, interning at a magazine in New York City and illegally subletting a run-down room, that advice just wasn't cutting it anymore. I was one semester away from graduation and the real world, and I was dreading it. One of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague: ""This is Julia Carpenter, and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job."" It was true. Many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy, and unequivocally, they were miserable. Many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like New York or San Francisco and waited months for a job. Some worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away. When I was reading ""Lean In"" within the mouse-ridden confines of my apartment, Sandberg's words stoked the long-squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals. As an English major and a journalism student, many of the feminist tenets in ""Lean In"" weren't new to me, but they also weren't applicable to me yet. She urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership, not a trade-off. Many of her stories about the intersection of family planning, motherhood and careerdom didn't have much of an effect. Those were things I'd been reading about in women's studies textbooks for years, examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back. What was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts. For every lesson, Sandberg had a story to share about boardroom drama at Facebook, Google and elsewhere. In my young life, I hadn't had any Peggy Olson moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom. Instead, Sandberg's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion, of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women's success. I had been passed on for projects because of reasons like ""Why would a girl be interested in politics?"" and the word ""bitch"" had been thrown at me to end a conversation. Sandberg's examples provided simple solutions: Speak with purpose. Sit at the table. Sandberg writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace. In my case, it was in the world of job hunting. We fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as ""pushy."" No one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she's trying to get a job. I realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that I wanted was even scarier than not having a job. I feared that I would be waiting in the wings, clutching my pages-long rÃ©sumÃ© and feeling insecure, as droves of confident, talented men dared to sit at the table. I knew to get that dream job, I was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys, just as Sandberg wrote. 'Is there a job there for me?' Closing that confidence gap isn't easy, especially after a lifetime of ""Wait your turn."" I read that when Sandberg was job hunting -- honestly, more like ""job picking"" -- then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave her some invaluable advice, which ultimately became my guidepost. ""Only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth."" In my own job hunt, in the midst of interviewing and applying, I found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to: ""Did they even get my application?"" ""Oh my God, they hated my application"" and of course, ""Why did I even send in an application, I suck."" On the other hand, men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications. ""I've been really forward (almost to the point of being pushy?) in the last year,"" a member of our Lean In Circle told me. ""But the only consequence there might've been for that is not getting a response to an application."" Not all of Sandberg's advice resonated with my Circle. Business cards and job titles don't mean much to us, and unlike many of Sandberg's contemporaries, we've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism. ""A lot of my job search happened over beers, over shared criticisms, over social media interactions,"" said one member of my Circle. ""If I said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book, the person I was talking to would think I was a robot. When members of my Circle discuss job prospects -- which we're doing ever-more-frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask isn't ""What's the position?"" Instead, it's ""What would you be doing?"" The day before I graduated from college, I received a job offer from the magazine where I had interned while reading ""Lean In."" The job was awesome. I would be living in a city I loved, working with amazing people and doing something I knew I was good at. But my heart was still set on another opportunity. A member of my Circle had referred me for a sweet spot on the Washington Post's digital engagement team, but after a few rounds of interviews I was still waiting for an answer. ""You just have to wait,"" people told me. My newly Sheryl-fied inner voice said otherwise. I called and explained the situation. ""Is there a job there for me?"" I remember saying. ""We were going to offer you the job tomorrow,"" my now-boss said. ""So -- what are you thinking?"" 'That's my girl' At a recent brunch with a college friend, she told me she's happy at her job, but looking for the next step, hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills. ""I want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings,"" she said. ""But I don't want to. I don't want to impose. They're going to be like 'Who is this girl? Why is she e-mailing me?' And I know my male colleagues wouldn't think twice. They'd send that e-mail."" I immediately made a mental note to add her to our Circle. I know my Circle members would say it's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace, and you have to lean in bit by bit. They're right. If anything else, you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women, even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly. So even when I couldn't find a connection with Sandberg's discussion of work-life balance and motherhood or the buttoned-up culture of top tech executives, ""Lean In"" can't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women. For me and my Circle -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- Sandberg's simple suggestion to proceed boldly, empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions. We're wary of the gender gap not just in salary, but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices. Even in the early days of a new gig, we're committed to closing that confidence (and achievement) gap. That's something we can take away from the pages. That's why a Circle is more than just a book club. In the middle of a conference call at work last week, I jumped into the conversation. ""I can explain this,"" I said, and launched into a short description of a project my team and I had been rolling out. ""When you said 'I can explain this,' you actually leaned in,"" a female colleague said to me afterward. ""You physically leaned in closer to the desk. I was like, 'That's my girl.'""

"(CNN) -- English cricketer Kevin Pietersen has reached an agreement with the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which paves the way for his return to the national team. Arguably England's most naturally talented cricketer, Pietersen was dropped by selectors in August after it emerged he had sent ""provocative"" text messages to South Africa's players during a recent Test series between the two teams. However the South-African born Pietersen must undergo a ""reintegration program"", before England team director Andy Flower can pick him. ""ECB and Kevin Pietersen confirm that agreement has been reached concerning a process for his reintegration into the England team during the remainder of 2012,"" said an ECB statement. ""Upon completion of the program, the England selectors will consider Kevin for future matches."" Without Pietersen, who was born in South Africa, defending champions England crashed out of the World T20 tournament in Sri Lanka at the Super Eight stage. Two years ago the allrounder was man of the tournament when England, captained by Paul Collingwood, were crowned T20 world champions in the Caribbean. In May, Pietersen had announced his retirement from T20 and one-day cricket, although he was in Sri Lanka working as a broadcaster for ESPN Star Sports. Andrew Strauss, who was England captain when Pietersen was frozen out of the team, has since retired from international cricket, with Alastair Cook the side's new Test skipper. ""Kevin Pietersen has apologized to Andrew Strauss and wishes to express to all those who support England his regrets at the impact the recent controversies have had on the England team,"" continued the ECB statement. ""He now wishes to put the events of the summer behind him and to focus on regaining his place in the England team."" The ECB went on to say the issue regarding messages sent from Pietersen's Blackberry mobile phone had been resolved. ""With regards the issue of the BBM messages, due to the fact that Kevin had not retained the BBM messages, this matter has been successfully concluded through a binding assurance provided to ECB by Kevin. ""Kevin conceded that the messages exchanged were provocative. The ECB is satisfied, following receipt of this binding assurance, that to the best of his recollection, Kevin did not convey any messages which were derogatory about the England captain, the England team director, the ECB or employees of the ECB. ""Furthermore, there was no tactical information whatsoever provided to members of the South African touring party."" ECB chairman Giles Clarke refused to put a timescale on when Pietersen might return. ""Kevin has signed a central contract today,"" Clarke told a media conference. ""Andy Flower will determine the progress of the reintegration process. It could be soon, it could be much later."" Pietersen admitted the situation had been difficult, but insisted he was focused on regaining his place in the team. ""It's been a horrible situation for all involved,"" said the 32-year-old cricketer. ""But it is time to move forward. All being well I'll be back in an England shirt as soon as possible."" Before he was dropped, Pietersen has been integral part of the England Test team since making his debut in 2005. He has scored 21 centuries in 81 Test matches for his country and was given the honor of captaining England's one-day team in 2008. The right-hander, who is an occasional spin bowler, will be hoping to win back his place in the team in time for November and December's tour of India.","Kevin Pietersen agrees return to the England cricket team .

"Damon Smith denies making or possessing an explosive substance with intent to endanger life but at the Old Bailey he admitted perpetrating a bomb hoax.
The prosecution said Mr Smith intended the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to explode and endanger the lives of people on the Jubilee Line train.
Prosecutors said the IED contained ball bearings to act as shrapnel.
Jonathan Rees QC, for the prosecution, said this was to ""increase the destructive effect of the device"".
At the start of the trial, Mr Rees said the defendant told police he had built a device which when activated was intended only to produce smoke.
However, the defendant added the ball bearings because he wanted to make it look like a real bomb so the train would be stopped and it would be reported on the news, Mr Rees added.
The court heard the device was found by two passengers when Mr Smith got off the train at London Bridge station last October.
They handed it to a driver, Adrian Clarke, who initially thought it was for lost property but then, as he drove to North Greenwich, realised it contained two wires coming out of the back of a clock, the court heard.
The court heard the student had moved to Rotherhithe in south-east London with his mother from Newton Abbot, Devon, when he started a computer forensics degree at London Metropolitan University.
The defendant has Asperger's syndrome, or Autism Spectrum Disorder as it was known, and has a keen interest in guns and other weapons that may have been a function of the condition, the court heard.
The prosecution said officers had found:
The court heard Mr Smith told police he had been brought up a Christian but was interested in Islam which he thought was ""more true"".
He did not really practise Islam, although he read the Quran and sometimes prayed in the morning when it was convenient but did not hold extreme views, the court heard.
Mr Rees said that on the day of the incident the defendant had started a timing mechanism on the device while he was at Southwark station, changing trains.
Meanwhile, Mr Smith went to his university campus at Holloway and searched for news articles on the incident when he got home later, the court heard.
The trial continues.","A student has admitted building a bomb and leaving it on a Tube train but said it was for a prank, a court heard."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 12 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 13 June 2012 . A dentist suffered a near fatal stroke after performing a particularly gruelling tooth extraction. Sporty Andy Davies, 33, managed to admit himself to hospital in Birmingham after falling ill in November 2011. His stroke was so severe he experienced 'locked-in' syndrome and was unable to lift a limb, speak or breathe without a ventilator. His only way of communicating was through his eyelids. Hopeful: Today Andy's condition is stable and he is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement . Mr Davies's mother Barbara, from Liverpool, said Andy believed the extraction was probably to blame. He began to suffer from headaches and neck pain before eventually admitting himself to hospital where it was discovered he'd torn an artery in his neck causing a bleed on his brain stem . Doctors at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth hospital fought to save Mr Davies's life after the stroke. He was then put into an induced coma by medical staff to allow his body to cope with the massive trauma he suffered last November. Doctors caring for him have been amazed at his recovery from a bleed that could have easily killed him. Mr Davies - who qualified at Birmingham and has a practice in the city - was unable to move at all for around 10 weeks until life began to flicker back into his hands and legs. Today Andy’s condition is stable and he . is gradually and slowly regaining strength and movement, learning to . sit, stand, walk and talk again. The family are also hopeful he will . soon have sufficient strength to feed himself again. He is currently being cared for at rehabilitation centre called Moseley Hall, in Birmingham, although his funding is due to run out in the next few months. Mrs Davies, 27, said: 'My husband is an extraordinary man. He has achieved so much in his career and helped so many people. 'He has offered support to ex-offenders, drug users and single mums through his involvement with our church. 'Despite the poor prognosis offered by doctors after the stroke, I am confident Andy will make a recovery. This is a story of hope.' Mr Davies was a keen climber and skier before his stroke . Andy, who had been a keen climber and skier, has been able to return to his home in Bourneville a couple of times. Last weekend he stayed overnight at home and was able to attend a friend’s wedding. His mother Barbara added: 'The stroke was horrific and this has been a terrible ordeal for all the family. 'I would like to thank all the hospital staff who have helped Andy.' Andy qualified at Birmingham University in 2002, becoming the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. Since then he has worked for the NHS in general dental practice in Birmingham  where he met Emma. And the pair were married in 2008. Mr Davies was the first dyslexic to qualify as a UK dentist. He hopes one day to return to work . Emma, a teacher said: 'We were told that if Andy survived he would be left with ‘Locked in Syndrome’ which would leave him unable to communicate or move with no prospect of any independent life. We were told to prepare for the worst and that people didn’t recover form such situations.' She added: 'No one is quite sure what caused the stroke although Andy thinks the trigger was the tooth extraction which may have damaged the artery and caused it to split later.' The couple are both Christians and Emma believes the power of prayer and the help of doctors has aided Andy’s remarkable recovery. Emma said: 'We believe God answered our prayers when Andy was initially given no hope.' Andy's mother said: 'He is now able to sit on the edge of a bed for three and a half minutes; when he first came to Moseley he could only sit for 30 seconds. 'His standing has also improved. Just ten weeks ago he started out using a standing frame, which mechanically raised him into a standing position and held him there. 'Now Andy no longer needs a hoist and can push himself up and briefly hold it there with the assistance of therapists, who help with the process.' Emma said: 'Thousands of people round the world have been following Andy’s blog and have been praying for him. He’s come a long way since those dark days in November but there’s still a lot work to be done. We are hopeful that he will walk unaided again and we pray that he may one day go back to work.'

"(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's ""fed up with negativity,"" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. ""It was ... horrific,"" she said simply. However, with her latest album, ""The Loving Kind"" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. ""It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,"" she said. Describing herself as someone who was ""fed up with negativity,"" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. ""[The] American people will not let this country collapse,"" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. ""In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,"" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (""The Loving Kind""), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to ""The Loving Kind,"" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about ""Not Innocent Enough."" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song ""Still Life"" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like ""Up Against the Rain,"" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like ""Rain,"" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: ""Sing"" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.","Nanci Griffith's new album is ""The Loving Kind""

"By . Sarah Griffiths . His body was buried 600 years ago without any pomp and ceremony befitting of a king. But now the traditional funeral crown that Richard III never had, has gone on display in York. The golden headpiece was commissioned for the last king of the House of York by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III’s remains beneath a car park in Leicester. Richard III's funeral crown (pictured) was commissioned by a leading historian who was involved in the archaeological dig that discovered Richard III¿s remains beneath a car park in Leicester . Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church, which is now the site of the council car park. Dr John Ashdown-Hill commissioned a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king with white roses and gems. Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 and was buried without pomp and ceremony . The crown was made by medieval jewellery expert George Easton who was inspired to create the design from historical artefacts such as relics and illustrations relating to the contentious monarch. ‘The crown is plated with gold, with the circle set enamelled with white roses and pearls,’ The York Press reported. ‘On the roses are set rubies and sapphires, representing the livery colours of the house of York. The crosses of the crown have more enamelled white roses, set with emeralds and turquoises.’ The historian had the idea of commissioning the crown when he was carrying the king’s remains away from the archaeological site, having been involved in searching for the lost remains of the monarch. The funeral crown is now on show at the Richard III Experience in York's Monk Bar – one of the medieval gateways to York. It will go on tour around the UK before playing a part in the king’s reburial at Leicester Cathedral. It was announced earlier this week that Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial'. Distant relatives opposed plans to bury him in the city after his remains were discovered in a council car park. They said he should be placed in York Minster because it was a wish of 'the last medieval king of England'. The skeleton of Richard III  was discovered at the Greyfriars excavation site in Leicester, which was a church and is now the site of a car park. Now there is a 15th century-style gold-plated crown in tribute to the late king . Regal: The crown is plated with gold, with enamelled white roses. There are rubies and saphires at the centre of the roses representing the livery colours of the house of York . But the High Court told the claimants, who are part of the Plantagenet Alliance, there was no reason to interfere with the initial plans. Three judges said in a joint ruling: 'Since Richard III’s exhumation on September 5 2012, passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt. 'Issues relating to his life and death and place of re-interment have been exhaustively examined and debated. 'The Very Reverend David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral, has explained the considerable efforts and expenditure invested by the cathedral in order to create a lasting burial place 'as befits an anointed King'. We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest.' Location: Richard III will finally be laid to rest at Leicester Cathedral after judges said it was time for the monarch to be given a 'dignified burial' Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verified form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life. Discovered: The remains of Richard III (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists in a council car park in Leicester. There have been heated discussions as to where the king is to be buried and the high court has now confirmed that he will be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral .","Golden crown was commissioned by a historian involved in the archaeological dig that recovered Richard III from a Leicester car park .

"By . Helen Nicholson . The construction of Stonehenge has been voted the historical event that most Britons would like to travel back in time to witness. The evacuation of Dunkirk, and the defending of Hadrian’s Wall by the Romans came second and third in the poll conducted by English Heritage. The organisation carried out the survey to celebrate the launch of six weeks of living history events across the country this summer, including medieval jousts, knights and princess training academies, and the chance to meet some of England’s most famous kings and queens. Still a mystery: English Heritage's Jeremy Ashbee said people wanted to discover more about who built the historic stone circle - and why . A total of 2,272 people were quizzed about which iconic historical event they would like to have been present at. The lifting into place of the enormous stones at Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago topped the poll with almost half of those surveyed (47 per cent) wishing they’d been there to see it. The masterminding of the evacuation of British soldiers from the Dunkirk beaches during the Second World War was the next choice (34 per cent), while seeing Roman soldiers patrolling Hadrian’s Wall came third (26 per cent). Going underground: In second place, people wanted to watch the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation during the Second World War from the Secret Wartime Tunnels underneath Dover Castle . Watching Victorian scientist Charles Darwin conduct his revolutionary experiments from his home in Kent (23 per cent) and the first Viking raid at Lindisfarne Priory (18 per cent) were also popular choices at fourth and fifth place respectively. King Harold falling in combat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (17 per cent) and Henry V preparing his troops ahead of the battle of Agincourt in France (16 per cent) also made it into the top ten. Added to this, 68 per cent of adults said they wished they knew more about history and 47 per cent said they planned to visit a historic place this summer. Stepping back in time: The defending of Hadrian's Wall by the Romans . came second in the poll, while watching Charles Darwin (right) conducting experiments at Down House came in fourth . Jeremy Ashbee, Head Properties Curator at English Heritage, said: ‘There are so many things we don’t know about Stonehenge and perhaps that’s why it topped our poll, with people wanting to discover more about who built the stone circle, and why. ‘It is great that there is such an appetite for history.

"(CNN) -- ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" National Incident Commander Thad Allen said Friday of the now-plugged BP gusher in the Gulf, adding that officials are now considering other options in addition to the relief well. Work will resume on a relief well as scientists and BP engineers continue to assess whether a planned ""bottom kill"" is necessary, he said. The BP oil well, which ruptured April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico before being successfully shut. Allen said that pressure tests were finished and that pressure within the wellhead was unchanged. That means there are options about how to handle the well, which has stopped pouring oil into the Gulf, he said. ""We have successfully shut in this well. We have something now that we haven't had before and we have we have -- I wouldn't call it a luxury -- but we have the trade space to consider alternatives under less than a high-pressure situation."" Allen said crews probably did ""too good a job on the top kill."" Cement and mud got into a core area of the well. But Allen said it's not clear how thick the cement layer is, or how vulnerable it might be to pressure inside the well. ""Everyone agrees we need to go forward with the relief well,"" Allen said. ""The relief well will be finished. How it gets finished will be determined on risk mitigation and the way forward is the essence of what is being discussed right now. The relief well will be finished. We will kill the well."" As they await answers about the condition of the well, businesses in the Gulf Coast are hoping high-profile visitors will help boost local economies. President Obama and his wife, Michelle, plan to travel to the region this weekend to support businesses that have been devastated by the oil disaster. One of their daughters, Sasha, will join them for the trip. Their other daughter, Malia, is at a camp and will not make the trip, a senior administration official said. The family will leave Saturday morning for Panama City Beach, Florida. ""Even as the president talks about what our next steps are in our response, obviously part of this will be highlighting the tremendous economic toll that has taken place,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters earlier this week. Visitors spent more than $34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the Gulf Coast, sustaining 400,000 jobs. The effects of the oil spill on the region's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $22.7 billion, according to an analysis conducted last month by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association. In preparing the research, Oxford Economics looked at current spending, government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the Gulf disaster's impact. Case studies of past disasters -- including the SARS respiratory disease outbreak, Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Asian tsunami -- show that tourism often is affected beyond the disaster area and long after the resolution of the crisis. To mitigate the effects of the disaster, changing perceptions is key. ""The president will meet with those folks and have a chance to update, I think, the region on where we are,"" Gibbs said. ""And I think it will be important for the president to talk about what are the next steps in bringing the region back."" Meanwhile, work is expected to resume Friday on the drilling of a relief well that is intended to give engineers a better look at the core of the well. Pressure tests will help them make a recommendation to former Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government point man on the disaster, on whether a bottom kill is necessary to permanently seal the ruptured deepwater oil well. The well erupted after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 dead. A temporary cap contained the spill on July 15, and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back under the ocean floor last week in the static kill process. The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (nearly 2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped. Since then, fresh, green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in some places. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Work on relief well will resume .

"Indeed, closing the gap between what the government spends and what it takes in taxes was the government's main mission.
But it has proved harder than Mr Osborne had hoped. He would blame circumstances beyond his control which - again - threaten to push his targets further back.
His critics on one side would say the initial pace of the cuts are what dragged the recovery down - a self-defeating object.
Critics on the right would say in fact he's lacked the courage to go far enough.
In the febrile atmosphere less than 48 hours before a Budget, there is agreement on one thing - whether  fast or slow, the most straightforward cuts, practically and politically, have gone.
Former head of the Home Civil Service Lord Kerslake, who was until recently one of the most senior officials involved in the hunt for savings, says clearly: ""It's hard to see where the easy choices are now.""
He told me: ""The savings that have to be found will require very substantial changes in the way things are delivered - or, indeed, the offer made.""
In other words, public services will have to be delivered much more cheaply, or the public will have to accept very different levels of provision.
And with Mr Osborne significantly behind on his own original targets from 2010, by accident or design, Lord Kerslake told me: ""We've still got some way to go, no more than half on the numbers.
""The important thing to say is that the second half is much harder because the sense of crisis that drove the savings in the coalition government has ebbed, the wider economy is growing so people can't see a comparable position there and people just get exhausted by the process.
""The easy savings have been done. So where do you go?""
Well, the chancellor is likely to announce further squeezes on welfare spending - the government has already outlined taking another billion out of the budget allocated to disabled people.
There are likely, by 2020, to be cuts of an extra Â£4bn a year by 2020. To raise revenue, there could possibly be a rise in fuel tax - politically difficult but lucrative for the government coffers - maybe hikes in insurance premiums, and what one Tory MP  described as ""nibbles here and there"".
With the European referendum bearing down on Numbers 10 and 11 there is a desire not to stir up too much controversy, not to distract too much from their main task in hand.
But as Lord Kerslake warns, taking anything else out of government budgets that have already been slimmed down is tricky - a task almost bound to cause complaint in itself.","Year after year, Budget after Budget, George Osborne has stood at the despatch box and promised to balance the books."

"(CNN) -- The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill appropriating $20 million to kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard to settle her claims against the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the chief clerk's office. The bill passed on a 30-1 vote in the Senate and a 62-0 vote in the Assembly, according to CNN affiliate KCRA. Corrections officials entered into the settlement with Dugard, the station said. Dugard vanished in 1991 at the age of 11. She was found in August 2009, living in a shed in the Antioch, California, backyard of Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender who had been on parole since January 1988. Investigators say Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity. He and his wife, Nancy, are charged with 29 felony counts in the case. Both have pleaded not guilty. In a report issued in November, the state inspector general's office found the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation failed to properly keep tabs on Garrido or properly supervise the officers assigned to his case. ""While it is true that Garrido's California parole was never officially violated, our review shows that Garrido committed numerous parole violations and that the department failed to properly supervise Garrido and missed numerous opportunities to discover his victims,"" the report said. Parole officers failed to investigate utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held, to check out the presence of a 12-year-old girl during a visit or to act on information the report said ""clearly"" showed Garrido had violated the terms of his release, the report said. Dugard, who is now 30, her mother and her daughters had filed a claim saying state corrections officials failed to do their jobs, seeking psychological, physical and emotional damages, KCRA said. The settlement process was ""pretty much unprecedented,"" said Jeff Long, spokesman for Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, who sponsored the bill. The language was inserted into a bill concerning claims against the state. Fuentes is chairman of the Assembly's Appropriations Committee, Long said. Every year as part of the budget process, the chair submits two bills for judgments against the state, Long said. It was decided that this would be the quickest way to get it through the Assembly, he said. Officials thought the state might have a case if it fought Dugard's claim, but it wasn't worth the case going to a jury, Long said. Because the constitutional deadline for an approved state budget has passed and California is in a new fiscal year without a budget, no appropriations can be made without Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's consent. Schwarzenegger has to request the bill be moved to his desk to sign it, Long said. Garrido was paroled in August 1988 after serving 11 years of a federal kidnapping sentence. He also served a five-year term in Nevada for rape charges. The November report from California Inspector-General David Shaw was limited to reviewing the actions of state parole officers in charge of monitoring Garrido from June 1999 until Dugard and her children were discovered. But Garrido was under the supervision of federal parole officers when authorities say he kidnapped Dugard in 1991, and they also ""failed to detect Garrido's criminal conduct and his victims,"" the report says. Garrido was only ""properly supervised"" for 12 out of the 123 months he was under California's supervision, ""a failure rate of about 90 percent,"" Shaw told reporters in November.

"Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot by a former police officer, known only as E7, as police sought to move in on him over a double stabbing . Firearms officers are threatening industrial action after a former policeman was charged with murdering a drug dealer during a Scotland Yard operation. Armed officers are said to be considering a staged walk-out after it was confirmed that the ex-officer will stand trial over the 2005 death of Azelle Rodney, who died in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen. Rodney, 24, was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head in Edgware, north London. The man accused of murdering him, only the third policeman to be charged with committing murder in the course of his duties, can only be identified as E7 after being granted anonymity during a public inquiry. The secrecy order, made in accordance with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which grants people the right to a family life, could be lifted when the ex-officer makes his first appearance in court in September. The decision to charge E7 was welcomed by Rodney’s mother, who has campaigned for justice for nearly a decade and may be in line for a huge compensation payout from the Met. But it has left Scotland Yard chiefs worried about possible ‘industrial action’ by some police firearms officers who might lay down their weapons in support of their former colleague. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for armed policing, said the move to charge E7 had left officers shocked. He told The Times: ‘Firearms officers volunteer for the role and many are now considering their future career choices. ‘Officers are not above the law and they are accountable for their individual decisions, but carrying a gun on behalf of the state is a big ask and it just got bigger.’ The decision to charge E7 comes after a three-month public inquiry into Rodney’s death, led by former judge Sir Christopher Holland. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ‘We have carefully considered the new file of evidence submitted to us and have decided that a former Metropolitan Police officer, currently identified only as E7, will be prosecuted for murder. The individual currently has anonymity.’ The murder suspect will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 10. The shooting took place outside The Railway Tavern on . Hale Lane in . Edgware, north London. Forensic experts are pictured at the crime scene after the incident took place in April 2005 . After . the findings of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney's death were published, . his mother Susan . Alexander, pictured middle, called for an investigation to be opened. She is pictured with lawyer Daniel Machover, right and Leslie Thomas, . from Garden Court Chambers, left . Rodney’s mother Susan Alexander said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’ Rodney was hit by eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point blank range. The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney. The murder charge against E7 is . believed to be only the third time in recent years that an officer has . been charged with murder while on active duty. PC . Chris Sherwood from Sussex Police was acquitted of murder in 2001, . after he shot James Ashley, 39, while he was naked and unarmed. The shooting had taken place while police searched his flat in Hastings, East Sussex. The officer said he believed Mr Ashley was mistakenly pointing a gun at him and was about to shoot. The . Chief Constable of Sussex, Martin Richards, who was the nominal . defendant in the civil case that followed, admitted negligence and . agreed to pay the family damages. But the force always strongly denied misconduct. In . an earlier case - and believed to be the first of its kind - . Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared at the Old Bailey of . the murder and manslaughter of suspected car thief David Ewin, 38. He stood trial three times after the jury failed to deliver a verdict on the first two occasions. He had always denied both the murder and manslaughter of Mr Ewin in Barnes, south west London, in February 2005. The . officer, then 49, was part of the crew of an armed response vehicle . that had spotted the stolen Toyota sports car parked outside a shop. Mr Ewin died from his injuries after the shooting. Officer E7 claimed he feared Rodney was about to fire a submachine gun. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were jailed for seven and six years respectively in January 2006 after pleading guilty to possession of firearms. Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home. In court he claimed that he had let Rodney use his flat as a crack factory to cancel out a drugs debt. At the time of his death Rodney was wanted over a double stabbing in Ealing. There have only been two previous cases where police officers were charged with murder. In 1997 Metropolitan Police PC Patrick Hodgson was cleared of the 1995 murder of suspected car thief David Ewin in Barnes, south-west London. The second related to PC Chris Sherwood, who was accused of murder after he shot suspected drug dealer James Ashley while he was naked and unarmed when officers searched his flat in St Leonards, East Sussex, in 1998. He was cleared in 2001. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents more than 125,000 rank and file officers, held discussions about firearms officers conducting ‘unofficial strikes’ when marksmen faced the prospect of being charged with murder in two other cases. The shootings of unarmed decorator Harry Stanley in 1999 and Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 were mired in controversy but possible walkouts were averted when prosecutors ruled out murder charges. E7 has been supported in his legal battle by the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation, whose chairman John Tully said: ‘Parallels may be drawn with the Harry Stanley case going back a number of years when two officers were arrested. ‘At the time there were concerns about the lack of support from senior management and Government. It’s a very difficult job.’ But he added: ‘I have not detected any similar feelings in the workforce currently. It could have an impact on morale.’ The Police Firearms Officers Association said the case had raised many issues. A spokesman said: ‘The decision by the CPS to prosecute E7 raises many issues around the role of armed policing and officers having confidence in the law should they be involved in a shooting.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","24-year-old died in Edgware, London, in April 2005 after being shot six times .

Marina Moskvicheva, Chelyabinsk health chief, told the Russian news agency Interfax that 985 people in her city asked for medical help and 43 were hospitalized. It was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century and occurred hours before a 150-foot asteroid passed within about 17,000 miles (28,000 kilometers) of Earth. Planetary scientists said there were no connections between the meteor that passed over Siberia and the larger asteroid. It is unknown if the fireball spotted in California had any connection to the asteroid.

A retired watchmaker who set up a cannabis factory in his garage shot a burglar who was trying to break in to his remote farmhouse, a court heard today. Malcolm White, 63, fired at Robert Richards when he caught him trying to smash his living room window in October 2011. The burglar, who fired back at the homeowner before fleeing in a getaway van, was so badly injured when he was arrested that doctors had to amputate his right leg. On trial: Malcolm White, pictured with his partner Josephine Merrick, is accused of shooting a burglar at his home . Break-in: Robert Richards and Darren Randall attempted to burgle the farmhouse in Herefordshire, pictured . But White insists that the shooting was an accident, and has pleaded not guilty to unlawful wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm at Worcester Crown Court. A jury heard that the retiree spent 20 minutes locking up the garage which contained his £18,000 cannabis farm before he reported the attempted break-in at his £420,000 home in Whitborne, Herefordshire by Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26. He told officers he believed the robbers had been after his Audi A8 sports car - but failed to inform them he had shot one of the thieves. The jury was told that White had a total of 20 firearms stashed around his home, and boasted to partner Josephine Merrick that he 'shot the bastard' during the botched burglary. Investigation: Police found £18,000 worth of cannabis plants at the house when they searched it . Prosecutor Simon Phillips said that White was 'no ordinary householder' and shot Richards in order to 'protect his turf'. He continued: 'The reality was, Mr White knew this raid was a possibility and took the initiative to shoot Mr Richards before he knew it. 'He was protecting his turf and was prepared with a number of firearms around his property. 'In Mr White's garage was a valuable and extensive crop of cannabis. He was somebody who had something to protect.'

"Mansfield District Council debated the £250m Lindhurst scheme, which faced more than 140 objections.
It includes up to 1,700 homes, as well as a new primary school, cemetery, community centre and park on the southern edge of the town.
The planning committee voted five in favour, five against, with the chairman having the casting vote in favour.
Protesters at the meeting shouted ""shame"" as the decision was made.
The 169 hectare (417 acre) application is the largest ever submitted to the council.
Developers, the Lindhurst Group, said it would bring major benefits to the local economy, including up to 4,000 jobs.
Project co-ordinator, Richard Bowden, said: ""We are relieved. We now have a major responsibility to deliver the jobs promised.
""For a development of the size and momentum that is going to be needed to turn Mansfield around, there was no alternative.
""We just hope that now we have the planning consent, people will look at the merits of what we are doing - at the enormous amounts of money that will be coming into the Mansfield economy.""
But objections included concern from Nottingham Wildlife Trust and the Ramblers Association over the loss of countryside and habitat.
Independent Mansfield councillor Andrew Tristram, who opposed the plans, said concerns over congestion and the ability to deliver the promised benefits remained.
""Given the fact the decision was controversial and decided on a casting vote, and also the reasons for departing from the local plan were tenuous, I'm sure local residents would like to see the secretary of state call the decision in,"" he said.",Plans for a major development of houses and businesses in a Nottinghamshire town have been narrowly approved.
"It’s been nearly three months since a photograph of Kathy Griffin posing with a replica of President Donald Trump‘s bloodied, decapitated head in her hand sparked nationwide outrage — and changed her life forever. 
  
 In an in-depth interview with New York magazine’s The Cut, the comedian — who, in the wake of the scandal, was fired from the CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast that she had co-hosted with Anderson Cooper for 10 years — discussed the controversial photo at length, revealing that it was the catalyst that ultimately ended her nearly two decade-long friendship with Cooper. 
  
 When the photo surfaced on May 30, the CNN anchor took to Twitter to condemn it: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,” he wrote. “It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

 According to Griffin, in the following days, four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to check on her and offer private support. Cooper, however, didn’t contact Griffin until Aug. 10, The Cut confirmed with CNN. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about his relationship with Griffin on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper said that the two were still friends.

 “Yeah, we’re still friends,” he said. “And look, I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back. She’s incredibly funny and a lot of people love her and I think she’ll bounce back from this.” 
  
 Cooper had previously made similar statements during an appearance at Arizona’s Comerica Theatre on June 11: “I don’t want anybody’s career to be destroyed because they do something unfortunate and inappropriate,” he said at the time. “Look, I wish her well and I hope she bounces back and keeps doing what she does best, which is make people laugh.” 
  
 “CNN made the decision not to bring her back,” he added. “I had nothing to do with it, but I certainly understand why they made that decision.” 
  
 Griffin, 56, told the magazine that the fact that Cooper was publicly claiming they were friends while not checking in with her hurt deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper, 50, told the magazine that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.”

 According to Griffin, other celebrities were more solicitous in the aftermath, such as Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx, who both spoke publicly in support of the comedian. According to Griffin, Amy Schumer personally sent her a funny video and former Today show host Billy Bush — who was notoriously caught up in his own Trump-related scandal — reportedly suggested in a note that Griffin stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 Despite the far-reaching consequences of the photo, Griffin told The Cut she’s tired of apologizing for it.

 “Why are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that tweets like this?” she said. “I’m a comedian; he’s our f—ing president.” 
  
 “President Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a concentration camp in the Arizona desert,” she later added. “He said there are some good Nazis, and he’s kicking out young adults who were brought here as kids by their parents, and I’m the one who has to continue to apologize?” ||||| Kathy Griffin walked into her home office just before noon in late June, still wearing pajamas. The comedian, who regularly stays up late, had just woken up to news of President Trump’s latest Twitter tear. Trump had covered a wide range of topics in a series of tweets, from denouncing Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the election to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer — or, as Trump called him in a tweet that morning, “Cryin’ Chuck.” 
  
 “Why are people still expecting me to apologize and grovel to a man that tweets like this?” Griffin vented to me. “I’m a comedian; he’s our fucking president.” 
  
 It had been 23 days since a photograph of Griffin holding a Donald Trump mask covered in fake blood completely altered her life. Cooked up as satire in a single afternoon, it first appeared on TMZ and then spread across social media rapidly, uniting Republicans and Democrats in outrage. Griffin released a video apology almost immediately after the photo’s release, but the damage was done; the next day, Trump intensified the backlash by tweeting a claim that his son Barron, 11, was having a difficult time dealing with the image. And members of the First Family, including Trump’s two older sons, launched an aggressive public campaign against Griffin. 
  
 In the following days, the Secret Service opened an investigation; Griffin was fired from the CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast that she had co-hosted with Anderson Cooper for ten years; a lucrative endorsement contract was canceled, and so were 15 scheduled live performances, owing to bomb threats, which she estimates cost her more than a million dollars. Thousands of death threats rolled in, some of her close friends abandoned her, and even her beloved Fox News–loving mother, Maggie Griffin, joked to her daughter that she would not have her support. 
  
 A carefully choreographed apology tour might have helped Griffin move past the controversy — the video she filmed the day the photo was released felt hasty, and a defensive press conference a few days later was widely criticized after Griffin (who had, after all, fired the first salvo against Trump) presented herself as a victim. But moving on doesn’t seem to be on Griffin’s mind: The short promotional video she just released for her new Laugh Your Head Off tour of Europe, Australia, and New Zealand concludes with an image of her in the same blouse she wore in the infamous Trump photo, holding a globe in her hand instead of a Trump mask. And she’s still angry with the president. 
  
 “President Trump just pardoned Joe Arpaio, who was essentially running a concentration camp in the Arizona desert,” she tells me over the phone this past weekend. “He said there are some good Nazis, and he’s kicking out young adults who were brought here as kids by their parents, and I’m the one who has to continue to apologize?” 
  
 Between these two conversations, I visited Griffin at her home in Los Angeles a number of times (we first met a dozen years ago at a party; in the last year, after she reached out to me via Twitter DM, we began discussing politics regularly). She paid $10.5 million last year for a 13,000-square-foot mansion with all the trappings; her next-door neighbors are Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. “I’ve moved in next door to my act!” she tells me. (She says they’re excellent neighbors and don’t make any noise. When I was with Griffin, Kardashian sent her a text message to see how she was feeling.) 
  
 Griffin, who made her career by mocking celebrities, is not the most likely comedian to be martyred over the inalienable right to criticize the president. But in the past couple of years, her act has become more and more political. She says that has led some of her fans to bristle. “Comedians talk about what their audience is faced with every day, we try to relate to our audience,” she says. “I’m obsessed with politics. I always have been, and now, with Trump, many people are obsessed with politics, so that’s going to be a big part of my act.” 
  
 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the right to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los Angeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel normal, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly outrageous comedy. “I would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a human being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,” she tells me. “Comics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that responsibility.” 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. “When the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it served as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,” she says. “You may say I deserved it, but just think about it … the president of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isn’t punching down, I don’t know what is.” 
  
 Griffin says she isn’t a victim: “I am in a position of privilege, I will be fine,” she says. “But what about any American citizen, whether they’re artists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media — will they face a federal investigation?” Griffin also worries about the “chilling effect” created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army of supporters. She thinks that just as she’s taken responsibility for her provocative image, Trump “has to take responsibility for the power he holds with his Twitter account.” 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffin’s sentiments, it’s fair to wonder what the image of Trump’s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given the hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump early and hasn’t wavered since, says he found Griffin’s image “way outside the boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions against Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for reasons to delegitimize you.” Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Trump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. “The moment I saw the picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen. It’s a useful meme for Trump: It’s the left that incites violence, it’s the left that engages in hate.”

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photographer known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hanging a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afterward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatched her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchup. They wanted to comment on Trump’s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly — “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” — after she questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican presidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffin’s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comment) released the image — although he didn’t tell her where it would go first. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly tabloid’s framing — “Kathy Griffin wants Donald Trump’s head … but she wants it bloody and detached from his body” — didn’t ponder any deeper meanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actually wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But that’s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, “This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.” Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly tweets about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, “It wasn’t right when peoplel [sic] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn’t right now.” 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffin’s reputation as a shock comic, she is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendment attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasn’t at all concerned. Her first question was, “Oh, is it getting around?” I discouraged her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of followers, but there was no stopping her — she told me that she was well-versed in dealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the image, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie O’Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she had made. O’Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple question: “What is James Foley’s mom going to think when she sees this?” Foley, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in Syria. 
  
 Griffin’s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans continued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didn’t. The next morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffin’s mental health saying, “[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.” The reaction from Trump’s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper asking him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trump’s son Eric, appeared on Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The White House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 It’s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going after any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platform of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a “highly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor. He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense there’s something that offends him.” Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and loss of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offended by Griffin’s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a guest of Trump’s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaign, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffin’s social media was flooded with detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded with angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail — some of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specificity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and their opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred the image of Trump’s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly over the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannity’s behalf. 
  
 There’s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with her newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was released. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in women’s advocacy, is a ubiquitous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been retained by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from friends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inflame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffin appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had been the victim of an unprovoked attack. “None of the points I wanted to make in that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like a victim. I take responsibility for that,” she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldn’t even find a reputable crisis-management expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasn’t found a publicist. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, “We aren’t taking on new clients right now” — Hollywood speak for “we don’t want you.” Griffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars who’ve made statements that have landed them in the crosshairs of the Secret Service — like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassination joke on camera — have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it helps that Trump didn’t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. She’s gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffin’s sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Service investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, stoking Griffin’s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be used against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has contributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minnesota senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall with California congressman Ted Lieu, and she’s appeared regularly on MSNBC to talk about LGBT and women’s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, California. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly and Pelosi’s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it involved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension for years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her career in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. According to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act and they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she says. New Year’s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the CNN gig didn’t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directly to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving record ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooper’s straight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours since she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to say she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffin’s pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she says Zucker said to her, “I don’t need this, you don’t need this. He’s come after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.” Griffin reluctantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
  
 Griffin’s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under tremendous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the same night: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.” Griffin acknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their long friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independently confirmed this). But Cooper didn’t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN confirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohen’s talk show, Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. “Yeah, we’re still friends, and look I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back,” he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not checking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.” 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Hollywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says, reassured her that her career wasn’t over and that every comic would give their right arm for the act she’d have after the controversy died down. A comedic movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer sent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me describe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she broke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrities, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. They’ve been calling and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I reached out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned away. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (it’s unclear when the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who knows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directors of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Award–winning producer who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritten letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griffin shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, “Now with my world crumbling around me, I am listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doing. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the ‘Left.’ It took my terrible mistake to finally see the false news,” and “I do not deserve what I am asking of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.” Kopelson said that Griffin should “exclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,” adding, “Do not send to the other networks.” “If you don’t do exactly what I’ve written, your career is over,” Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Corporation declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, “I’m tied up” as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the phone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelson’s email was indicative of “men who control the checkbooks,” who, despite the entertainment industry’s liberal reputation, tend to be more conservative and don’t like people who rock the boat. She acknowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mentor Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed to build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. Her concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 years, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. She’s hoping to organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and she’s working on a documentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, although none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although she’s still too worried about her physical safety to tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take it easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. “The way Trump wins is if he shuts people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,” he said. “She has to go back to war.”

 Griffin, who made her career by mocking celebrities, is not the most likely comedian to be martyred over the inalienable right to criticize the president. But in the past couple of years, her act has become more and more political. She says that has led some of her fans to bristle. “Comedians talk about what their audience is faced with every day, we try to relate to our audience,” she says. “I’m obsessed with politics. I always have been, and now, with Trump, many people are obsessed with politics, so that’s going to be a big part of my act.” 
  
 In the course of our talks, the theme she returned to most forcefully was the right to provoke with humor. Griffin describes a visit to an LGBT center in Los Angeles, during which an AIDS patient asked her to mock him so he could feel normal, as a defining moment in her career, and an example of the value of seemingly outrageous comedy. “I would be abandoning my principles as a comic and a human being if I backed off President Trump or any public person,” she tells me. “Comics by their nature are anti-Establishment. They are charged with the often unenviable task of going after people in power. I will never abdicate that responsibility.” 
  
 Griffin fears the impact of what happened to her will resonate further. “When the president tweeted about me the morning after I released the image, it served as an executive order of sorts to his family and supporters to go after me,” she says. “You may say I deserved it, but just think about it … the president of the United States and his family are going after a stand-up comic who had a show on the Bravo network called My Life on the D-List. If that isn’t punching down, I don’t know what is.” 
  
 Griffin says she isn’t a victim: “I am in a position of privilege, I will be fine,” she says. “But what about any American citizen, whether they’re artists or not, who innocently post a shocking photo on social media — will they face a federal investigation?” Griffin also worries about the “chilling effect” created by the retribution wielded by a vengeful president and his army of supporters. She thinks that just as she’s taken responsibility for her provocative image, Trump “has to take responsibility for the power he holds with his Twitter account.” 
  
 Even if one agrees with Griffin’s sentiments, it’s fair to wonder what the image of Trump’s severed head signified beyond the obvious interpretation, and whether Griffin should have realized how much blowback it would create, given the hyperpolarized media environment that surrounds the president. 
  
 Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican political consultant who denounced Trump early and hasn’t wavered since, says he found Griffin’s image “way outside the boundaries and unhelpful against the cause. I understand how strong passions against Trump run, mine do very frequently, but people are always looking for reasons to delegitimize you.” Charlie Sykes, a conservative political commentator and former radio host who is famously anti-Trump, tells me that Griffin gave Trump and his supporters a big gift by releasing the image. “The moment I saw the picture, I knew [the outcry from Trump and his supporters] was going to happen. It’s a useful meme for Trump: It’s the left that incites violence, it’s the left that engages in hate.”

 The photos were improvised in an afternoon: Tyler Shields, a celebrity photographer known for his provocative images (he once shot an image of a black man hanging a member of the KKK), was taking some updated portraits of Griffin, and afterward, they decided to create some spoof images involving Trump. Griffin dispatched her assistant to find a Trump mask and a friend made fake blood using ketchup. They wanted to comment on Trump’s infamous comments about Megyn Kelly — “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever” — after she questioned him about his history of sexist comments in the first Republican presidential debate in 2015. 
  
 With Griffin’s permission, Shields (who did not respond to requests for comment) released the image — although he didn’t tell her where it would go first. Shields, according to Griffin, chose to give it to TMZ, and the Trump-friendly tabloid’s framing — “Kathy Griffin wants Donald Trump’s head … but she wants it bloody and detached from his body” — didn’t ponder any deeper meanings. Griffin, perhaps naively, assumed that no one would ever think she actually wants to kill anyone, much less the president of the United States. But that’s exactly what some people thought. 
  
 Chelsea Clinton tweeted, “This is vile and wrong. It is never funny to joke about killing a president.” Will & Grace star Debra Messing, who regularly tweets about her distaste for Trump, tweeted, “It wasn’t right when peoplel [sic] hung lynched Obama effigies, just as what Kathy Griffin did isn’t right now.” 
  
 When I first saw the photo on Twitter, I assumed it was a private, unfortunate gag that had leaked somehow. (Despite Griffin’s reputation as a shock comic, she is also an astute manager of her image and her act who keeps a First Amendment attorney on retainer.) 
  
 I called Griffin as the heat was building, but at that point she wasn’t at all concerned. Her first question was, “Oh, is it getting around?” I discouraged her from posting the photo on her own accounts, which have millions of followers, but there was no stopping her — she told me that she was well-versed in dealing with controversy. After it became clear that Griffin stood behind the image, a brewing controversy turned into a full-on firestorm. Three hours later, I got an Instagram alert on my phone: Griffin had posted her apology video. 
  
 It was a call from Rosie O’Donnell that made Griffin realize the mistake she had made. O’Donnell arguably has had more ire directed at her from Trump than any other celebrity, but she confirmed to me that she asked Griffin a simple question: “What is James Foley’s mom going to think when she sees this?” Foley, an American journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in 2014 while on assignment in Syria. 
  
 Griffin’s apology appeared to satiate her liberal fan base, but Republicans continued to be outraged. Her hope was that things would calm down over the next few days and she could try to return to normal life. But they didn’t. The next morning, as many expected, Trump tweeted about the incident: “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!” 
  
 The First Lady, Melania Trump, released a statement questioning Griffin’s mental health saying, “[A] photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.” The reaction from Trump’s sons and daughter-in-law was even more aggressive. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted repeatedly about Griffin and even tweeted at CNN anchor Jake Tapper asking him if Griffin would be fired. Lara Trump, who is married to Trump’s son Eric, appeared on Sean Hannity’s program on Fox News to denounce Griffin. (The White House declined multiple requests to comment on this story.) 
  
 It’s hard to imagine any other U.S. president, much less his family, going after any entertainer the way Trump and his family went after Griffin. Wilson told me that he finds it ironic that Trump, who rode into the White House on a platform of decrying political correctness, has presided over the development of a “highly refined outrage culture, particularly around himself. There is no humor. He and his supporters will go to DEFCON 1 if they sense there’s something that offends him.” Wilson added that he has also dealt with death threats and loss of business because of his commentary about Trump. 
  
 Sykes and Wilson both tell me they refuse to accept that Trump was truly offended by Griffin’s image. On June 23, it was revealed that Al Baldasaro, a member of New Hampshire’s House of Representatives and a top Trump supporter, was a guest of Trump’s at a bill-signing at the White House. During the 2016 campaign, Baldasaro said on two occasions that Hillary Clinton should have been shot by a firing squad. 
  
 As the photo spread around the internet, Griffin’s social media was flooded with detailed and gruesome death threats. The agency that represented Griffin for television work had to shut down their switchboard because they were flooded with angry calls. In the week after, she received death threats via mail — some of the messages, which I reviewed, were stunning and frightening in their specificity. 
  
 Fox News featured the Griffin controversy throughout their programming, and their opinion hosts talked about it length. While many news programs have blurred the image of Trump’s head, Hannity showed it in its original form repeatedly over the past 89 days, even though he claims that the image could incite violence against Trump. A Fox News spokeswoman declined an interview on Hannity’s behalf. 
  
 There’s a chance that Griffin could have recovered from the controversy much sooner, had she not made the fateful decision to hold a press conference with her newly retained attorney Lisa Bloom just three days after the photo was released. Bloom, known as an attorney who specializes in women’s advocacy, is a ubiquitous presence on cable television whose fame has increased as she has been retained by clients who have accused President Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly of sexual assault and harassment, respectively. 
  
 Before the press conference, Griffin received text messages and emails from friends, begging her not to go through with it; they felt it would only further inflame the situation. But Griffin felt that she would look erratic if she canceled, and she was also feeling wounded by all the attacks. It was a disaster: Griffin appeared defensive and nervous instead of resolute. She talked as if she had been the victim of an unprovoked attack. “None of the points I wanted to make in that press conference came across because I said I was a victim and acted like a victim. I take responsibility for that,” she says. 
  
 In the aftermath, Griffin says she couldn’t even find a reputable crisis-management expert to take her on as a client, and she still hasn’t found a publicist. Entreaties from her team are met with responses like, “We aren’t taking on new clients right now” — Hollywood speak for “we don’t want you.” Griffin decided to leave WME, the agency that has represented her for television projects, but she is staying with her longtime concert agent at ICM. 
  
 Meanwhile, other stars who’ve made statements that have landed them in the crosshairs of the Secret Service — like Johnny Depp, who made a Trump assassination joke on camera — have seen the ensuing controversy swiftly go away (it helps that Trump didn’t tweet about Depp). 
  
 For the past two and a half months, Griffin, who says she traveled to 80 cities last year as part of her comedy concert tour, has been in hibernation. She’s gone to five social functions and a few business meetings. In July, Griffin’s sister Joyce was diagnosed with cancer and Griffin shaved her head in solidarity. The thousands of death threats have trickled to mere hundreds. The Secret Service investigation, after an hour-long interview, remained open for two months, stoking Griffin’s fear that somehow the levers of government power might be used against her, until her lawyer was finally informed that the inquiry had closed. 
  
 In the past few years, Griffin, who has always been a political junkie, has contributed thousands of dollars to elected officials like Barack Obama and Minnesota senator Al Franken, according to federal records. She co-hosted a town hall with California congressman Ted Lieu, and she’s appeared regularly on MSNBC to talk about LGBT and women’s advocacy. Griffin says she was supposed to host a fundraiser for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at her home the week after the photo was released. In July, she adds, she was slated to speak at Politicon, a convention of political and media leaders from both parties, in Pasadena, California. All of that went away almost immediately. Franken admonished her publicly and Pelosi’s office canceled the fundraiser. 
  
 But getting fired by CNN was the most public indignity for Griffin because it involved business and personal relationships that had been fraught with tension for years. Griffin credits CNN president Jeff Zucker with reinvigorating her career in 2003 when she was doing stand-up at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. According to EW, Zucker, then president of NBC Entertainment, came to see her act and they eventually struck a deal for Griffin to have her own reality show on the NBC-owned Bravo Network called My Life on the D-List. 
  
 But since Zucker became CNN chief, he and Griffin had clashed regularly, she says. New Year’s Eve is a big money-making opportunity for entertainers, and the CNN gig didn’t pay very well. In 2015, Griffin says she called Zucker directly to see if he could bump up her compensation. The broadcast was receiving record ratings, Griffin was doing a lot of the work as the comedian to Cooper’s straight man, and the broadcast had gone from 90 minutes to four-and-a-half hours since she started doing it. 
  
 Griffin says Zucker was livid and told her that he could get comedian Samantha Bee to take her place. Zucker, Griffin says, called her agent and publicist to say she was fired. They eventually made up, but not before Zucker cut Griffin’s pay (she did get a raise in 2016). 
  
 Griffin also says that before the 2017 broadcast, Zucker called her at home to tell her she could only do four jokes about Trump (the first time there had ever been limits on her material during the special). When Griffin pushed back, she says Zucker said to her, “I don’t need this, you don’t need this. He’s come after me harder than anybody. I have to deal with this guy.” Griffin reluctantly agreed to the limit. Zucker, through a CNN spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
  
 Griffin’s best-known celebrity friendship, going back 17 years, is with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. But after TMZ published the photo, Cooper came under tremendous pressure to repudiate it. Without reaching out to Griffin, he tweeted the same night: “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.” Griffin acknowledges that Cooper was in an untenable position, but she feels that their long friendship afforded her a call or text message beforehand. 
  
 In the following days, Griffin says four of Cooper’s CNN colleagues reached out repeatedly to Griffin to check on her and offer private support (I independently confirmed this). But Cooper didn’t contact Griffin until August 10, CNN confirmed to me. 
  
 On July 26, when asked about Griffin on Andy Cohen’s talk show, Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Cooper claimed that Griffin was still a friend. “Yeah, we’re still friends, and look I said what I said about — I didn’t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back,” he told Cohen. 
  
 The fact that Cooper was telling people publicly they were friends, while not checking in with her, hurt Griffin deeply. When he finally reached out to her in a series of text messages, she told him their friendship was over. 
  
 A source close to Cooper tells me that Cooper was “shocked and upset by the photo, and while he was not ready to talk to her personally about it, he still considered her to be a friend, and was publicly supportive when asked about the controversy.” 
  
 Other celebrities were more solicitous. Advice and support flooded in from Hollywood friends, actors, and comics. One critically revered comedian, Griffin says, reassured her that her career wasn’t over and that every comic would give their right arm for the act she’d have after the controversy died down. A comedic movie legend said the incident would be a landmark in the way comedy is viewed. Jerry Seinfeld and Jamie Foxx made supportive comments publicly. Amy Schumer sent Griffin a funny video that Griffin played for me but declined to let me describe. When a couple who live in her gated community, but whom Griffin had never known or met, dropped off a cake and a note, Griffin was so touched that she broke down crying in her bed. 
  
 Despite all the private support, no entertainers were willing to speak to me on the record about Griffin. For this story, I reached out to a number of celebrities, especially comics, that Griffin is close friends with. They’ve been calling and texting Griffin in the past few months to check in on her. A few of them even initially told me that they would talk to me for this story, but when I reached out to their publicists to set up phone interviews, I was politely turned away. 
  
 There was also some unsolicited advice. An iconic actress told Griffin to stay at home and out of the limelight until Trump was impeached (it’s unclear when the actress thought that would happen). Former Today show host Billy Bush, who knows what getting caught up in a Trump-related scandal is like, suggested, in a note Griffin shared with me, that she stay quiet for a while and take up meditation. 
  
 The most disturbing advice came via email from a member of the board of directors of the CBS Corporation, Arnold Kopelson, an Academy Award–winning producer who Griffin used to consider a friend. Kopelson emailed Griffin with a prewritten letter to President Trump that he said she should mail to him, and which Griffin shared with me. 
  
 The letter includes phrases like, “Now with my world crumbling around me, I am listening for the first time about the great things you have done and are doing. How stupid I was to follow the lies from the ‘Left.’ It took my terrible mistake to finally see the false news,” and “I do not deserve what I am asking of you. I am begging you to open your heart and forgive me.” Kopelson said that Griffin should “exclusively release the letter to Fox Broadcasting,” adding, “Do not send to the other networks.” “If you don’t do exactly what I’ve written, your career is over,” Kopelson wrote. A spokesman for CBS Corporation declined to comment. When I called Kopelson for comment, he said, “I’m tied up” as soon as I explained the reason for the call, and hung up the phone. Kopelson did not respond to a request for comment via email. 
  
 Griffin tells me that Kopelson’s email was indicative of “men who control the checkbooks,” who, despite the entertainment industry’s liberal reputation, tend to be more conservative and don’t like people who rock the boat. She acknowledged that revealing details about people like Kopelson, Cooper, and Zucker is unusual, and could harm her future employment prospects. 
  
 But Griffin occupies an unusual space in comedy: Like her late friend and mentor Joan Rivers, she has constantly struggled to be taken seriously, but managed to build a substantial fan base that has enriched her and made her very famous. Her concert agent showed me Ticketmaster data indicating that over the past 13 years, Griffin has sold over 1.2 million tickets to her shows. 
  
 Griffin says she wants to focus on First Amendment issues now. She’s hoping to organize a First Amendment concert with the ACLU, and she’s working on a documentary film of her upcoming international tour, as well as a docu-series, although none of these projects has come to fruition yet. 
  
 In the meantime, although she’s still too worried about her physical safety to tour America, Griffin is off around the world. Her act will feature plenty of Trump jokes, despite the fact that some of her friends have suggested she take it easy on the president for a while. 
  
 Rick Wilson thinks she has no alternative. “The way Trump wins is if he shuts people up permanently and scares them off from being vocal critics,” he said. “She has to go back to war.”

"An independent commission concluded Ferdinand's response to a tweet describing Chelsea's Ashley Cole as a ""choc ice"" did not make him a racist.
""It is the idea that a black person is black only in skin colour but inside they are really white. It's a highly derogatory term. It's a dangerous term because it allows black boys especially but black people in general, to believe that there is a way of being black that is somehow distinct from being white. There are people that think if you don't wear a certain type of clothing or listen to a certain type of music you're not really black. It's a really dangerous thing. There are black boys who do less well in school because they believe by doing well there, they are acting white. To me, this is devastating for black boys and black people everywhere. It's a deeply offensive term with racial connotations.""
But it was ruled the centre-half had brought the game into disrepute.
""The commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race,"" read an FA statement.
Ferdinand was also warned as to his future conduct. Manchester United have decided not to appeal against the decision.
The United defender tweeted: ""I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic hahahahahaha!!"" in response to a message from @carltonEbanks which stated: ""Looks like Ashley Cole's going to be their choc ice. Then again he's always been a sell out. Shame on him.""
The term relates to the black and white nature of a choc ice and can imply someone is being black on the outside and white on the inside.
The tweet appeared on Ferdinand's timeline after Chelsea and England left-back Cole appeared in court as a defence witness for team-mate John Terry, who was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand's younger brother, Anton, in a game against QPR on 23 October last year.
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: ""They (the FA) want to close the door on this kind of thing.
""What surprises me is that other players have been twittering for ages and have never been challenged by the FA.
""His (Ferdinand's) status in the game has caused that and who he plays for is maybe another issue.""
In bringing their charge, the FA made it clear they did not feel Ferdinand was a racist, rather that he had acted improperly.
In a statement outlining their decision, the commission said: ""The Football Association clearly states that this is not an allegation that Mr Ferdinand is a racist, concedes that he is not a racist but contends that his conduct in endorsing @carltonEbanks tweet in a public forum is a term of abuse and brought the game into disrepute.""
This is Mr Ferdinand's first offence. He was the Football Association's 'Poster boy' and role model to other professional footballers in the use of Twitter and has a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football
Ferdinand conceded the tweet was insulting, although he insisted in the hearing he was not expressing a racist view.
The commission's report continued: ""Mr Ferdinand stated the words 'choc ice' was a reference to race... but also means the person is fake.
""He accepted that the words of the tweet were insulting and conceded that the term could only be used when referring to a black or mixed race person and not a person with white skin.
""Mr Ferdinand therefore admitted that the term 'choc ice' referred to Mr Cole's colour, ethnic origin or race.
""The charge is proven and the breach of FA Rule E3 was aggravated by reference to Mr Cole's colour, ethnic origin or race.""
The hearing did accept there were mitigating factors taken into consideration before they decided on their punishment.
""A number of factors have to be considered in determining the penalty,"" the statement read.
""This is Mr Ferdinand's first offence. He has a clear disciplinary record. He was the Football Association's 'Poster boy' and role model to other professional footballers in the use of Twitter and has a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football.
""It was in response to a tweet rather than an original tweet.""
A representative for Cole released a statement soon after Ferdinand's tweet to emphasis he still viewed the Manchester United defender as a friend.
""Ashley Cole wishes to make it clear that he and Rio Ferdinand are good friends and he has no intention of making any sort of complaint,"" it read.
""Ashley appreciates that Tweeting is so quick it often results in offhand and stray comments.""
Since Ferdinand's tweet Terry has been charged with improper conduct by the FA for the alleged comments he made to Anton Ferdinand, a charge he has vowed to contest.
Terry, 31, is alleged to have used ""abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour"" during the game.","Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand has been found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 by the Football Association for comments on Twitter."

"Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, emailed employees on September 3 to dispute allegations that the news network hindered or tried to kill Ronan Farrow's reporting on Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. 
  
 Dear Colleagues, 
  
 This is an unusual situation for a news division. In the last several days, questions surrounding how NBC News handled Ronan Farrow's investigation of Harvey Weinstein have resurfaced. The following pages lay out all the facts dispassionately and in necessary detail -- from start to finish. If you have any remaining questions, please don't hesitate to ask. 
  
 For the past nine months, it has been our belief that the 'story' here is about Harvey Weinstein's horrendous behavior and about the suffering and bravery of his victims, rather than a back-and-forth between a reporter and his producer and a news network. However, we've watched with disappointment as unfounded intimations and accusations have traveled through media circles. 
  
 At NBC News, one of our primary goals is to produce outstanding investigative journalism that stands up to intense scrutiny and has a meaningful impact on society. We had that goal very much in mind when we first assigned Ronan Farrow to look into rumors in Hollywood about Harvey Weinstein, as many other news organizations had done before us over the span of two decades. 
  
 We spent eight months pursuing the story but at the end of that time, NBC News -- like many others before us -- still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record. (Rose McGowan -- the only woman Farrow interviewed who was willing to be identified -- had refused to name Weinstein and then her lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter.) So we had nothing yet fit to broadcast. But Farrow did not agree with that standard. That's where we parted ways -- agreeing to his request to take his reporting to a print outlet that he said was ready to move forward immediately. 
  
 Seven weeks later, and five days after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey broke the Weinstein story in The New York Times, Farrow published the first in a series of outstanding stories for The New Yorker, winning great acclaim and attention, all of which is well deserved. That story cited the following victims by name: Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette, Lucia Evans, Emma de Caunes, Jessica Barth, and Sophie Dix. Not one of these seven women was included in the reporting Farrow presented while at NBC News. 
  
 We regret the deterioration of NBC's relationship with Ronan, and genuinely wish we had found a path to move forward together. That is why, in August of 2017, when Farrow objected to his editors' conclusion we convened an independent group of the most experienced investigative journalists in our organization to review his material with fresh eyes. We asked them -- tell us what, if anything, we can broadcast. But their conclusion was unequivocal -- this story is not ready for air. (Further, they found several elements in Farrow's draft script which did not hold up to scrutiny -- described in the accompanying document.) It was Farrow's decision, in the midst of this process, to pursue the story elsewhere. 
  
 Had we refused his request, NBC might have ultimately broken the story, but we wondered then, and still wonder now, whether the brave women who spoke to him in print would have also sat before TV cameras and lights. If we had tried to hold him and nothing changed, we would have needlessly blocked him from disseminating it via another forum. And that is why we agreed to let him go elsewhere. If some believe that decision a failure of our competitive instincts, so be it. But it was a decision undertaken honorably and with good intentions toward Farrow and his work. 
  
 Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow's reporting or ""kill"" an interview. Immediately after Farrow had parted ways with us, he asked for NBC cameras to record another anonymous Weinstein victim. Farrow conducted the interview but we declined the request for a crew because we believed filming another anonymous interview would not get us any closer to clearing the threshold to broadcast, and because he had already informed us he was pursuing the story for another outlet. (The victim Farrow anonymously interviewed did not ultimately speak on the record for The New Yorker or The New York Times.) Furthermore, we were increasingly concerned that repeatedly asking victims to sit for anonymous interviews in front of television cameras on this subject matter was no longer a productive approach. (For the record, the first television interview with a Weinstein victim aired on NBC News on October 9.) 
  
 Finally, a word on the baseless speculation that some interference by Harvey Weinstein played a role in our decision-making. The accompanying document recounts every interaction NBC News executives and editors had with Weinstein and his attorneys. It will surprise no one that they were dishonest in their dealings with us, often mischaracterizing our brief conversations. But in each instance, their calls were either completely ignored or met with a boilerplate commitment to allow them to comment if and when something was ready for broadcast. None of this was kept secret from Farrow. None of it was any different from the calls we receive on every other difficult story our investigative unit regularly breaks. And none of it played any role in our decision-making. 
  
 Our Investigative Unit, led by Rich Greenberg, is filled with the best journalists in the business doing a remarkable job. They consistently shepherd difficult stories onto the air and drive the daily news cycle. Over the past year-and-a-half they have delivered an astounding 420 exclusive stories on politics, national security, business and technology and more. 
  
 As we get back to work this week, we will continue to pursue the toughest stories, in the most challenging circumstances, involving the most powerful people. And we will keep doing it while upholding the journalistic standards that have been the backbone of this outstanding news organization. 
  
 Thank you for your great work this summer. 
  
 Andy ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Last week, in an interview with The New York Times, Rich McHugh, a former producer at NBC News who worked closely with Mr. Farrow, accused the network’s news division of impeding the reporting of the Weinstein story. He called NBC’s handling of the matter “a massive breach of journalistic ethics” and said unnamed higher-ups had ordered the cancellation of an interview with a Weinstein accuser in August of last year, effectively killing the investigation. 
  
 Mr. Lack’s email was partly an attempt to defend the network against Mr. McHugh’s statements. In his message to NBC News employees, the chairman publicly defended the network’s handling of the Weinstein story for the first time. 
  
 “Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow’s reporting or ‘kill’ an interview,” Mr. Lack wrote in the email. 
  
 The news executive went on to make the argument that Mr. Farrow’s reporting was not broadcast-ready last August, when he stopped working the Weinstein story for NBC. The main problem, he said, was the lack of on-the-record voices in the version of the story Mr. Farrow had prepared. 
  
 “We spent eight months pursuing the story but at the end of that time, NBC News — like many others before us — still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record,” Mr. Lack wrote. |||||","– The Harvey Weinstein scandal is leading to another controversy that just keeps growing: how NBC News handled the investigation. Network exec Andy Lack defended NBC in a memo to employees Monday, but reporter Ronan Farrow then accused Lack of fudging the facts, reports CNN. It all centers on a serious accusation: Did NBC try to kill the story that Farrow, then a reporter for the network, presented to his bosses about Weinstein? One of Farrow's former producers made that allegation last week, accusing NBC of a ""massive breach of journalistic ethics."" But in his memo, Lack insisted that what Farrow presented wasn't ""fit for broadcast"" because it had too few women willing to go on air to corroborate the accusations. ""Contrary to recent allegations, at no point did NBC obstruct Farrow’s reporting or 'kill' an interview,"" Lack wrote. He added that the network let Farrow ""go elsewhere"" to flesh out the story, to the New Yorker. Farrow, however, says Lack's statement ""contains numerous false or misleading statements,"" per the New York Times. For one thing, ""the suggestion to take the story to another outlet was first raised by NBC, not me,"" wrote Farrow, ""and I took them up on it only after it became clear that I was being blocked from further reporting."" He said his piece for NBC was ""twice cleared and deemed 'reportable' by legal and standards only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from Harvey Weinstein."" Lack says that's not true, and he dismissed as ""baseless"" the accusation that Weinstein himself exerted some kind of influence on NBC's decision. Farrow, for his part, is working on a book about the entire situation."
"(CNN) -- In The World According to Dennis Rodman, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he just saw on his second trip to the country, is quite likable. ""He has to do his job, but he's a very good guy,"" Rodman said Monday at a news conference, announcing plans for a ""basketball diplomacy"" event that will involve players from North Korea. Meanwhile, Kim presides over one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. As Human Rights Watch puts it, Kim's succession as supreme leader after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011, ""had little impact on the country's dire human rights record."" People are subjected to torture and thrown into prison camps based on political charges. Those who have managed to escape describe horror that includes beatings, starvation and executions. As CNN has reported, Kim Jong Un appears to have changed nothing in the camps. U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae knows first-hand.  He's currently in one, charged with ""serious crimes"" and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae's family says he owned a tour company and was in North Korea for work. The accusations against him were spelled out on state-run media, which is the only kind of media that ""very good guy"" Kim Jong Un and his country allow. Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . Par for the course in North Korea, where people have no freedom. In 2012, ""Defectors continued to report extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary detention, arrests of political prisoners, and torture,"" the U.S. State Department Human Rights Report says. ""The judiciary was not independent and did not provide fair trials. There continued to be reports of severe punishment of some repatriated refugees and their family members. There were reports of trafficked women among refugees and workers crossing the border into China. ""The government made no known attempts to prosecute officials who committed human rights abuses."" Meanwhile, much of the country starves. More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of 5 suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia. The North Korea we rarely see . Rodman: Come with me . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, journalists would realize that his rosy description of Kim is really the right one, if only they'd go over there and see for themselves. ""You write what you hear, but you don't see what you write,"" Rodman complained, saying he wants to bring a journalist on one of his trips to visit his friend. Yes, that's the problem, Mr. Rodman. North Korea is aching for journalists to roam freely around the country and report to the world what things are really like. ""My military minder tells me to turn my camera off, and it soon becomes clear why,"" CNN's Paula Hancocks wrote last month on a trip to the ""hermit kingdom."" ""The poverty I see through the bus window is not the view of North Korea the regime wants to be seen. ... Buildings are in disrepair; some barely look inhabitable. Residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do. A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners. ... Despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local community being monitored."" ""It was a tightly restricted, carefully stage-managed tour rich with propaganda and political theater and little else,"" CNN's Ivan Watson wrote in July of his five-day trip to Pyongyang. ""It offered virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who live in this rigid dictatorship."" ""We were not allowed to leave the confines of the Yanggakdo International Hotel unless we were riding a government bus. During my five days in North Korea, the authorities did not even allow me to see what the country's currency looks like."" ""Our three-man crew was assigned two very polite minders who accompanied us everywhere outside of the hotel and made no secret about the fact that they had veto rights if we were to take pictures of something that they didn't approve of,"" he added on CNN's GPS blog. ""So they would basically tell us what we could and could not take pictures of."" Rodman: Kim just wants to talk . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim Jong Un just wants to talk. ""It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds,"" he said Monday, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president. ""You don't have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call. That's all he wants."" Meanwhile, Kim might be even more bellicose than his father was. On CNN's GPS blog, three analysts say an analysis of language used in the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency ""shows the use of terms such as 'war' and 'nuclear' far more prevalent than terms such as 'peace' and 'reconciliation.' "" A U.S. defense official said North Korea has been using ""warmongering rhetoric."" Rodman: I held Kim's daughter . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim opening ""his heart and mind"" and allowing Rodman to hold his daughter ""for the first time in history"" is something to celebrate. Never mind that the existence of said child has been shrouded in secrecy. North Korea's regime is so restrictive that even state media haven't mentioned the possibility that their leader might have had a daughter. And speaking of children, Rodman shared an interesting detail Monday involving the ""basketball diplomacy"" event he's putting together with Paddy Power, an online betting company. ""The marshall"" -- the term Kim goes by -- ""gave me anything I wanted,"" he said. Kim told him, ""We've got 150,000 kids will do anything for you on the field. We've got 95,000 people will be in the stadium watching this game."" A dictator telling a foreign basketball player he can instruct 150,000 kids, who will comply: In The World According to Dennis Rodman, that's a good thing. Still, reason for hope . Any effort to, as Rodman says, ""bridge a gap"" with North Korea can be construed as a good thing. ""I said to him, 'Your grandfather and your father did some bad things ... but you are trying to change,' "" Rodman said at Monday's news conference. Kim has an ""image"" to keep up, he added. Maybe, one day, Kim Jong Un will knock down the walls behind which his country tries to hide its reality -- including the desperation, pain and horror described by defectors and refugees. Struggling for survival, family tries to feed child mice . But for now, Kim's propaganda machine is ratcheting up, as CNN has reported. Rodman says Kim asked him to do one thing: ""Tell the American people we're very cool."" Mission accomplished, Mr. Rodman.","Dennis Rodman calls North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""a very good guy""
Human Rights Watch says Kim has had little effect on North Korea's dismal rights record .

"Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- The U.S. Army private who authorities say admitted to planning to bomb a restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood is to be held without bond, a federal magistrate ordered Friday. Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo was formally charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges are likely, said Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San Antonio, Texas. Abdo, who refused to stand when Judge Jeffrey C. Manske entered the courtroom, shouted an apparent reference to the 2006 rape of an Iraqi girl by U.S. soldiers and the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan before being hustled out of the courtroom by marshals. Abdo, a Muslim American soldier who had been granted conscientious objector status before going AWOL, was being held Friday in federal custody at an undisclosed location. According to the criminal complaint unsealed after his appearance Friday, Abdo admitted he planned to turn two pressure cookers found in his Killeen hotel room into gunpowder- and shrapnel-filled bombs to detonate inside an unnamed restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood. Among other things, police and FBI investigators who searched the room found six bottles of gunpowder, shotgun shells and pellets and ammunition cartridges. Police who arrested him found wire, a handgun, ammunition and an article titled, ""Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom"" in the backpack he was carrying, according to the complaint. The backpack also contained a notebook with a hand-written list for many of the components police recovered. The public defender appointed to represent Abdo, attorney Keith Dorsett of Waco, did not immediately respond to e-mails and telephone messages seeking comment. Killeen police arrested Abdo, 21, on Wednesday after a gun store employee tipped them that Abdo's behavior had raised red flags when he purchased six pounds of smokeless gunpowder and other supplies. The tip came from Greg Ebert, a retired police officer who works at the Guns Galore gun store. He said the young man appeared suspicious as soon as he pulled up in a taxi cab. ""How many people go shopping at gun stores in a taxi cab?"" Ebert asked. He described Abdo as being guarded and asking odd questions. Abdo browsed for about 20 minutes, Ebert said, choosing six pounds of gunpowder, shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semiautomatic handgun. He asked Ebert what smokeless gunpowder was before finishing the purchase. ""Well, hello! Why are you buying this if you don't know what it's for?"" Ebert said later. ""That is a red flag for me. He should know. Why is he buying that much?"" Ebert said he called police after discussing the transaction at length with the owner of the store, which is the same place where Hasan bought supplies for his shooting spree. Abdo joined the infantry in 2009 and was assigned to Company E of the 101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team when he refused to deploy to Afghanistan on religious grounds. The Army approved his request to be discharged as a conscientious objector. But on May 13, he was charged with possession of child pornography on his computer, according to the statement. After a June 15 hearing, at which Abdo was recommended for court-martial, he went AWOL. In media interviews last year, Abdo talked about seeking conscientious objector status, saying he felt compelled to remain true to his faith. ""We have two things that I believe make us American, and that's freedom of religion and freedom of choice,"" he said. When he signed up for the military, Abdo said, he had not thought that his religious beliefs would be an issue. ""I was under the impression that I could serve both the U.S. Army and my God simultaneously,"" he said. But as his deployment neared, he began to rethink things and eventually worked up the courage to approach his unit and tell them how he felt, he said. ""Islam is a much more peaceful and tolerant religion than it is an aggressive religion,"" he said. ""I don't believe that Islam allows me to operate in any kind of warfare at all, including the U.S. military and any war it partakes in. I believe that our first duty as a Muslim is to serve God."" In court Friday, Abdo mentioned ""Iraq 2006,"" an apparent reference to an incident in which U.S. Army soldiers were accused of killing three members of an Iraqi family, including a 6-year-old girl, and raping the family's 14-year-old girl before also killing her and setting the bodies on fire in an attempt to cover up the killings. Four soldiers were convicted and imprisoned for their roles in the shootings, rape and subsequent cover-up. After Abdo's arrest, Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement calling it ""a sobering reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant in the ongoing efforts to protect our communities from those that would do us harm."" Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, the House Army Caucus chairman, praised the gun-shop employee who tipped police to Abdo, as well as the police themselves, for interrupting what could have been a deadly plot. ""Thanks to quick action by a Texas gun dealer in alerting local police to a suspicious character, and a prompt and vigorous response by the Killeen Police Department, we may well have averted a repeat of the tragic 2009 radical Islamic terror attack on our nation's largest military installation,"" he said. ""We now have an example of what works to prevent these type attacks, and as the coming days reveal more details about this attempt, we can determine better ways to thwart similar efforts in the future,"" Carter said. In addition to being the site of the Fort Hood shootings, Killeen is also where, in 1991, George Hennard crashed his pickup into a Luby's cafeteria, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 20 before killing himself. ""We've been through a lot in this community,"" Killeen Police Chief Dennis Baldwin said. ""But I can tell you that's when the character of the community is more obvious."" CNN's Tracy Sabo, Barbara Starr, Marylynn Ryan and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Naser Jason Abdo makes a reference to the 2006 rape and murder of an Iraqi girl .

"HP acquired the WebOS operating system when it bought veteran gadget maker Palm in 2011 for $1.2bn (Â£789m).
Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed but HP is not thought to have recouped much of the money it paid for Palm.
LG said the WebOS code would be used to power its next-generation smart TV technology.
The WebOS was created to run smartphones, tablets and other devices developed by Palm that, in its early days, pioneered the handheld gadget industry. However, Palm's influence has diminished as Apple, Google's Android and RIM's Blackberry have come to dominate the smartphone and tablet markets.
In the deal, LG gets WebOS source code, engineers working on it, documentation and the websites that promote it. HP is holding on to patents underlying WebOS as well as technology that helps it connect to web-based services.
HP did launch products running WebOS, such as the TouchPad tablet, but poor sales led it to seek other ways to boost interest in the software. One way it chose was to open up the code to any developer to work on. LG was one of the first firms to take up this chance and the acquisition grew out of this relationship.
Using WebOS in TV sets made ""sense"" for LG, said Ovum analyst Tony Cripps, adding that it could herald a return to the software's smartphone roots.
WebOS's use of core web technology left it well placed for the next generation of mobile apps that were likely to be based around the same code, he said.
The acquisition was probably driven by LG's recognition that it needed to make gadgets of all types easier to use, added Mr Cripps.
""Device manufacturers are recognising the need to differentiate through software-based innovation in user experience,"" he said.
The deal with LG was announced as HP took the wraps off its first Android-powered tablet, called the HP Slate 7, at the 2013 Mobile World Congress currently under way in Barcelona.","Electronics giant HP is selling off the code, staff and technology involved in its WebOS software to Korean firm LG."
"Philadelphia (CNN) -- At first, a Philadelphia landlord said, he thought one of his tenants was attempting to conceal a dog after finding a dog dish in the basement of his apartment building. But on a return trip to the basement Saturday, Turgut Gozleveli found something much more sinister: four mentally disabled people held captive, including one man chained to a radiator. ""It was terrible,"" he said Sunday, adding the people were surrounded by human waste. ""I don't know how long they were there."" Three people have been arrested and accused of holding the people captive and stealing their Social Security checks. Linda Ann Weston, 51; Thomas Gregory, 47; and Eddie Wright, 49, face charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, and false imprisonment, Philadelphia police said in a statement Sunday. The alleged victims include a 29-year-old woman and three men, ages 31, 35 and 41, said Philadelphia police Lt. Ray Evers. All seven -- the three suspects and four alleged victims -- had been traveling together, he said, but did not know for how long. Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged victims. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said. Gozleveli, who also serves as the building's janitor, said he was contacted Thursday by the block captain of a neighborhood group regarding suspicious activity. He checked out the basement that day and found a few things out of place, but no people. On Friday, he found the dog dish. On Saturday, after hearing a dog barking, he went to the building's sub-basement and found a door chained shut. He found the people after removing the chains. ""Other than the barking dog there was no sound,"" he said. ""... I said, 'What the hell are you doing here?' No answer, and I called 911."" ""This was a total surprise,"" Gozleveli said. ""I never expected to find people. I just expected to find a dog."" The people, he said, ""acted like children."" The four were in a room roughly 10 feet by 15 feet, Gozleveli said, and looked malnourished and disheveled. They had a metal bucket and a jug of what appeared to be orange juice, but no food. They also had pillows and blankets, but didn't know where they were or where they had come from, he said. Authorities believe the four were trapped in the tiny room for up to a week. Evers said they suffered from bed sores and ""injuries that are very, very hard to describe."" The alleged victims appeared to be malnourished and were taken to a hospital. They were listed in stable condition Sunday, police said. The FBI is also investigating. The northeast Philadelphia building is a former movie theater converted to a seven-unit apartment building. Police cars were still outside the building Sunday afternoon. The four people found in the basement were brought out on stretchers, said Danyell Tisdale, the block captain who notified Gozleveli. She said she was concerned about some of the things she'd seen recently, including people being brought in from the back of an SUV with out-of-state plates. ""I hope I did enough,"" she said.

"David Moyes insists that no-one is good enough to displace Wayne Rooney up front for both Manchester United and England. Moyes, who put Rooney at the heart of his Manchester United side before being sacked in April after less than a year in charge, reckons that the best could be yet to come from the forward - so long as he concentrates on scoring goals rather than all-action forays across the pitch. The Scot did, however, urge Rooney's team-mates to help ease the pressure on their captain by creating more chances for him.

Radamel Falcao's blockbuster loan signing at United has raised questions over Rooney's role in his club team, while Raheem Sterling's emergence has led to calls for the Liverpool starlet to fill the No 10 role in Roy Hodgson's side currently occupied by Rooney.

"A new project seeks to kickstart a revival for the world’s largest rainforest by planting new trees — tens of millions of them. 
  
 The project, announced Friday at the “Rock in Rio” music fest in Brazil, aims to restore 73 million trees in the Brazilian Amazon by 2023. Spanning 30,000 hectares of land (about 74,000 acres), the project is the largest tropical forest restoration in the world and helps Brazil move towards its Paris Agreement target of reforesting 12 million hectares of land by 2030. 
  
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” said M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International (CI), one of the partners behind the effort. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right — as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
  
 The Amazon forest is home to the richest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet — a recent report described some 400 new species discovered in the Amazon between 2014 and 2015 alone — yet is rapidly vanishing with increasing global demand for resources. The economy, essentially focused on the exploitation of natural resources, minerals and agribusiness, has already led to about 20 percent of original forest cover to be replaced by pastures and agricultural crops, without securing the well-being of the local population. The reforestation project fills an urgent need to develop the region’s economy without destroying its forests and ensuring the well-being of its people.

 “A new chapter is being written for the Brazilian Amazon with this initiative,” said Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of CI’s Brazil office. “Protecting the Amazon is not something we should think in the future — we have to do it now.” 
  
 The project is a partnership between Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio) and Rock in Rio’s environmental arm “Amazonia Live.” 
  
 The reforestation effort is part of a broader regional initiative, the Amazonia Sustainable Landscapes Project. This project aims to increase the area of forest ecosystems, promote the connectivity of protected areas within the Amazon, and further develop local productive activities and value chains derived from the sustainable use of Amazonian biodiversity, including production of native species of seeds and seedlings. 
  
 Priority areas for the restoration effort include southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. Restoration activities will include the enrichment of existing secondary forest areas, sowing of selected native species, and, when necessary, direct planting of native species, Medeiros said.

 Further reading ||||| There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we’ll ever know. It’s really not the best idea to let it burn up–and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we’ve had a hard time not cutting them down. 
  
 A new project should help prevent–or at least slow down–that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what’s known as the “arc of deforestation,” in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondônia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory. 
  
  
  
 “If the world is to hit the 1.2°C or 2°C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,” M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. “It’s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you’re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.” 
  
 He’s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet. 
  
 “This is not a stunt,” Sanjayan says. “It is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.” 
  
 Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different. 
  
  
  
 Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. “In Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,” says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International’s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground. 
  
  ||||| Assuming everything goes to plan, over the next six years, the Amazon rainforest will get 73 million new trees. The mass planting is part of a project sponsored by Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, and a number of other NGOs and corporations. As John Converse Townsend at Fast Company reports, it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted. 
  
 According to a press release from Conservation International, the effort will span deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several Brazilian states—with the greatest focus in Southern Amazonas, Rondônia, Acre, Pará and the Xingu watershed. The purpose of the project is, in part, to revive the 20 percent of the Amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture and pasturing during the last 40 years. But the effort is also geared toward learning how to restore tropical forests. 
  
 “This is a breathtakingly audacious project,” says M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, according to the release. “The fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right—as do the region’s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.” 
  
 As Townsend reports, reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time consuming—requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings, many of which will not survive. In this latest effort, the restorationists are trying a new method called muvuca, in which they will spread the seeds of native trees across the slash and burned land and animal pastures. The seeds come from the Xingu Seed Network, which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds from native trees. 
  
 “With plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare,” Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of Conservation International’s Brazil program, tells Townsend. “With muvuca, the initial outcome is 2,500 [trees] per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare. It’s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive than traditional techniques.” 
  
 The muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by Brazil to restore 12 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Pennsylvania, as part of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the Paris Accord. Recent studies show that second growth forests—those less than 60 years old that grow after logging or land clearance—can sequester huge amounts of carbon. As Townsend reports, just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 percent of current carbon emissions. Planting or restoring forests could make that number even bigger. 
  
 While the effort is impressive, it’s not the largest reforestation effort in the world. In July, 2016, 800,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, planted 50 million trees in just 24 hours, a publicity stunt to highlight India’s Paris Accord commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. The world’s largest program, however, is China’s Grain-for-Green effort, a plan to restore 69.2 million acres of forest land, which is an area the size of New York and Pennsylvania combined. 
  
 All of these efforts are encouraging, but replanting is only half of the solution. Twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year, writes Doug Boucher, Director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpful for the climate, the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take a while to see benefits. This means other more immediate solutions, such as reducing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests, are still necessary to make a dent in our changing climate. |||||","– The Amazon rainforest's ""arc of deforestation"" could soon have 73 million new trees. In an effort to reseed 74,000 acres of the Amazon—20% of which has been destroyed in the last 40 years—Conservation International, the World Bank, Brazil's environmental ministry, and several other groups are working together to spread seeds in the Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondonia, and Xingu areas of Brazil, reports Fast Company. Reforestation normally involves saplings, which must be grown and planted. But Conservation International CEO M. Sanjayan hopes dropping seeds from 200 native species per square meter of land, in what is known as the muvuca strategy, will ""drive the costs down dramatically"" and produce a greater diversity and density of plants. ""If you're really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of [the] atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most,"" says Sanjayan, noting the move will help Brazil reach its Paris Accord target of reforesting an area the size of Pennsylvania by 2030, per Smithsonian. A release notes it's the ""largest tropical forest restoration in the world."" Up to 2,000 locals will work together to seed each hectare, with families receiving $700 per hectare. Additional seeds will also be distributed in existing forested areas. Some 90% of seeds are expected to germinate, though only the strongest will survive. A leader of the program predicts there will be 2,500 trees per hectare after six years and up to 5,000 after 10 years. (Deforestation has revealed millennia-old ""geoglyphs"" in Brazil.)"
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A man opposed to joint South Korean-U.S. military drills attacked the American ambassador in Seoul, slashing his face and arm as he was about to give a speech Thursday morning, authorities said. North Korea quickly called the stabbing a ""knife attack of justice"" and said it reflected ""anti-U.S. sentiment"" in South Korea. Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for the knifing suspect, Kim Ki-Jong, an official at Seoul Central District Court said Friday. He was detained immediately after the attack, with authorities having time to formally arrest him or let him go. Kim, 55, who has a history of unpredictable behavior, could eventually be charged with attempted murder and other charges. A police official, Yoon Myeong-seong, also told reporters that Kim had previously visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were ""intensively investigating"" a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and this attack. The U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was in stable condition after undergoing more than two hours of surgery, in which he got 80 stitches to his face. He will probably remain hospitalized for three to four days, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik at Yonsei Severance Hospital. In 2010, Kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. The motive for his attack Thursday? He wanted an end to the South Korean-U.S. military drills to improve North-South relations, police said. The drills are held annually despite predictably harsh criticism from North Korea. The North Korean government believes the attack is ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers,"" according to its official news agency, KCNA. South Korean President Park Geun-hye, on the other hand, condemned it. ""This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador,"" she said, ""but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated."" U.S. diplomats have been attacked, killed in past . Lippert was attacked while attending an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between the two Koreas. The U.S. Embassy did not request special security for the event, Seoul police said. Three police officers were on duty at the building's entrance, and 25 others were on standby. Kim sat down at a different table than Lippert, then got up and ran to the ambassador's right side yelling something that sounded like anti-American sentiments. ""When the man jumped on the ambassador, I stood up and jumped on the man, and they both fell on the ground,"" a witness, Jang Yoon Seok, told CNN affiliate YTN. ""Luckily I got on top of the man's back and could press him to the floor. Then others came to hold him on the floor."" Jang said he later saw the knife on the table. It had a wooden handle and did not look particularly sophisticated, he said. Seoul police said a knife, about 10 inches long, was used in the assault and the suspect brought it from home. Videos showed the suspect pinned on the floor, rolled into a blanket and carried out of the building. He was heard shouting, ""The South Korea-U.S. military drills must stop."" The drills began earlier this week. Explaining the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises . After the attack, Lippert -- clutching his right cheek and holding a bloodied arm -- was photographed hurrying out of the Sejong Cultural Institute in central Seoul. The cut to his face runs from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw and is about 4 inches long and about an inch deep, Dr. Jung said. Fortunately, there was no damage to his facial nerve. Lippert also suffered five gashes in his left arm and hand, but he is not likely to have permanent damage to his arm function. ""The ambassador was very calm. People around him were taken aback, but he was very calm,"" said Dr. John Linton. ""He was speaking with his doctor on what to do. It was surprising."" As the ambassador left and headed to the hospital, investigators arrived, hoping to figure out exactly what happened. While there are videos showing what happened at the event, none of them will be from closed-circuit surveillance cameras, said Yoon, the Seoul police chief. The only such camera outside the building did help authorities determine exactly when Lippert and Kim came in. Was the attack part of a larger plot? Did Kim have any help, implicit or explicit? Not if you ask him, according to the Seoul police chief. ""Kim insists that this was done by himself,"" Yoon said. ""But police are still investigating if he acted alone and what his motive was."" Park, South Korea's President, told Lippert by phone that she was surprised and deeply troubled to hear about the attack -- an incident similar to one targeting her several years ago -- the Asian nation's Foreign Ministry said on its website. The South Korean leader vowed that authorities will ""take necessary measures ... with utmost seriousness and urgency"" to get to the bottom of the latest attack. She also promised to keep close ties with the United States ""so that the incident would not have any negative implications on the (South Korean)-U.S. alliance,""  according to the ministry. For Park's American counterpart, President Barack Obama, the attack is personal as well as political. That's because Lippert is a longtime friend and confidant, having been part of Obama's inner circle for years. Obama called Lippert ""to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. Lippert has been close to Obama ever since he arrived in the Senate in 2005. Lippert worked with Obama on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and traveled the world with the then-senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign. When Obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race, Lippert was by his side again, and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the Obama campaign. Obama nominated Lippert to serve as ambassador to South Korea last year. Thursday afternoon, Lippert tweeted that he was recuperating. ""Doing well & in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby & I - deeply moved by the support!"" he tweeted, referring to his wife, his son and his dog. ""Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK alliance!"" He then added in Korean, ""Let's work together!"" CNN's Judy Kwon, Paula Hancocks, Alexandra Jaffe, Stephen Collinson, Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta and journalist Hyoungjoo Choi contributed to this report.","Court: Authorities obtain an arrest warrant for the man suspected in the stabbing .

"Tests on three pairs of glasses held at the British Library showed the author's sight deteriorated considerably.
At the time, heavy metals like arsenic were used in medicines that Austen, who had rheumatism, may have taken.
Library experts have suggested such poisoning may also have contributed to her early death at the age of 41.
The novelist, who lived in Steventon, Hampshire, died on 18 July 1817 and the cause of her death has been the subject of much speculation.
The three pairs of glasses, kept in the Pride and Prejudice author's writing desk, were examined using a portable lens meter brought to the library to determine the strength of the lenses which, despite their age, remain in good condition.
Tests showed they increased in strength from +1.75 in each eye from the first pair to +4.75 and +5.0 in the final pair - meaning she would have found it very difficult to see well enough to read or write by the time she died.
British Library curator Sandra Tuppen said: ""There's the possibility of her being poisoned accidentally with a heavy metal such as arsenic. We know now that arsenic poisoning can cause cataracts.
""Arsenic was often put into medication for other types of illness, potentially for rheumatism, which we know Jane Austen suffered from.""
It is not known whether the glasses, made of real tortoiseshell and glass, were prescribed for Austen or she bought them herself.
The British Library is inviting optometrists to offer their opinions on the new theory.","Author Jane Austen was virtually blind at the end of her life possibly as a result of arsenic poisoning, experts have revealed."
"(CNN) -- The chief of staff to the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement resigned Saturday amid allegations that she helped create a culture of sexual discrimination against men. Suzanne Barr, chief of staff for ICE Director John Morton, voluntarily stepped down last month and had been on paid leave. In a letter to Morton, obtained by CNN, Barr called the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit"" and said she was confident her reputation would be restored. ""In recent weeks, I have been the focus of unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation, but of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,"" she wrote. ""As such, I feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work."" ICE spokesman Brian Hale said Morton has received Barr's resignation. ""We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors,"" he said. The move comes on the heels of a job discrimination lawsuit filed by the head of the ICE office in New York against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. In the suit, New York ICE chief James Hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women, some of whom used to work for Napolitano when she was governor of Arizona. As part of his lawsuit, Hayes cites behavior by Barr in an attempt to prove an alleged culture of sexual discrimination against men, according to Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Maryland. Hayes said Barr ""created a frat house-type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees."" When the lawsuit was filed, ICE spokesman Hale said the allegations were under review and that Barr had voluntarily placed herself on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. That review is ongoing, according to a federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""We are obviously very pleased with the agency's first step in rectifying this situation by accepting Ms. Barr's resignation,"" said Fischer, Hayes' attorney. ""Now is the time for the agency to move forward and make restitution to the individuals harmed."" Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Barr's resignation ""raises the most serious questions about management practices and personnel policies at the Department of Homeland Security."" The committee will continue a review of the case and the personnel practices of the DHS in general. In his lawsuit, Hayes blames Barr for ""sexually offensive behavior."" In one alleged incident, Hayes said Barr called a male employee at a hotel and screamed at him, using crude language to say she wanted to have sex with him. Hayes also said that Barr moved the office contents of three male employees into a men's bathroom at ICE headquarters in 2009. After his client's lawsuit was filed, Fischer said, he was contacted by other federal employees who had heard about Hayes' claim. They provided affidavits to Hayes and his lawyer alleging more sexually charged comments made by Barr, according to Fischer. ""We've been getting calls and e-mails from all over the country from people who want to come forward with information that may be helpful on this case,"" the attorney told CNN. In an affidavit provided to CNN, another ICE employee describes a 2009 meeting in the office of ICE Director Morton, during which employees were discussing personal plans for Halloween. The male employee says he overheard Barr ask a ""senior ICE employee"" about the size of his genitals. ""You're a sexy mother-(expletive),"" she allegedly said. Over 17 years, Hayes rose through the ranks from Border Patrol agent to a top position at headquarters in charge of Detention and Removal Operations, overseeing a $2.5 billion budget, his lawsuit states. Hayes claims he was removed from that job because of gender discrimination. He is suing to recover $335,000 in moving costs and lost bonuses he says he incurred when he was transferred in 2009 to New York from Washington. His lawyer says other ICE employees have been reimbursed for similar expenses. Hayes' lawsuit also claims he faced retaliation after threatening to file an Equal Opportunity Claim against DHS and cites six internal investigations that were all unfounded. However, all but one of those investigations against him involving complaints by fellow employees were initially filed before Napolitano took office in 2008. In court documents, Hayes said the complaints were reviewed after he began complaining. DHS has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and denied allegations of discrimination and retaliation. Its attorneys argued that the ""unfounded allegations"" made against Barr are ""irrelevant"" and an ""attempt to embarrass or harass senior government officials."" According to a federal official who defended ICE as an agency of ""dedicated law enforcement professionals,"" Hayes' lawsuit is filled with ""false and unsubstantiated"" allegations against Barr and other DHS employees. The allegations ""do not align with the fact that Mr. Hayes has routinely held high-ranking assignments, including his current position as head of ICE's second-largest field office in New York, the official added. CNN's Ross Levitt and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Suzanne Barr calls the allegations ""unfounded and without any merit""

"Phnom Penh (CNN) -- More than 20 striking garment workers were injured this week, including two pregnant women, during clashes with police outside a factory in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia, a labor leader said. Roughly 4,000 workers have walked off the job at a factory owned by Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing, which supplies Nike and Lululemon Athletica. They are demanding a $14 monthly increase, from the $74 they make now, said Say Sokmy, secretary-general of the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Police used stun batons to disperse strikers on Monday, she said, injured more than twenty. Both Nike and Lululemon released statements, expressing concern about the incident. ""As outlined in Nike's Code of Conduct, Nike requires its contract manufacturers to respect their employees' rights to freedom of association,"" the U.S.-based company said in a statement. It continued: ""Workers are employed by the contract factories, not by Nike, and wages and compensation are the responsibility of the factories. It is our understanding that this factory raised its own minimum wage on May 1 and pays above the country's minimum wage."" Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica said its sustainability teams are monitoring events and are in daily contact with the factory to ensure workers' safety. ""We require all of our vendors to uphold and respect the workers' rights around the freedom of association and collective bargaining as stated in our lululemon Code of Ethics,"" said Therese Hayes, vice president of sustainability. ""The current situation deeply concerns us and we will continue to be in close contact with our factory partner, and take any immediate actions if necessary."" Both companies stressed that the factory is part of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), a program established by the International Labor Organization to monitor workplaces and offer advice. According to BFC, the garment industry employs some 400,000 workers and accounts for $4 billion, or roughly 80%, of Cambodia's total export revenue. Most of what's made is exported to the European Union and the United States. READ MORE: Inside a Bangladesh garment factory that plays by the rules . OPINION: Stop cashing in on Bangladeshi workers .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 6 January 2014 . Doctors are concerned that data harvested from patients by the Government will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients . Doctors are rebelling against plans to harvest personal information from the medical files of millions of patients. From spring, officials will begin building a giant database they say will help them identify poor performance such as long waiting times and late diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. They believe the information might even lead to new treatments. But there is widespread concern among MPs, academics and doctors that the data will fall into the hands of hackers or be sold to insurers and drugs firms for use in targeting patients. NHS England, which is overseeing the scheme, says privacy will be ensured because only dates of birth, postcodes and NHS numbers will be stored. But each year more than a million medical files go missing from the Health Service – many of them lost on public transport or dumped in bins. Unless patients tell their GP in person or over the phone that they do not want to be involved in the scheme, their data will be harvested automatically. Critics say the NHS is making it deliberately difficult for patients to opt out – given how hard it is to make an appointment with a doctor or even speak to them on the phone. At least two GPs are so opposed to the scheme they have removed the thousands of patients on their books from it unless they have specifically asked to be included. One of the doctors, who is based in Oxford and is remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals, said he believed the scheme breached data protection laws. Starting today, the NHS will begin dropping leaflets through the doors of all households explaining the scheme. It is not clear whether patients will have to see their GP in person or call the surgery - it will vary between practices. There is also concern most of the public will never read them because they will be lost among junk mail. David Davis, a Tory MP and former shadow home secretary, said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy. To make patients go in and make  an appointment with their GP is  frankly disgraceful. 'The database does have huge value for the NHS but it will go wrong. Some people's information will be lost. If hackers can take on Microsoft, how long until they get to the Department of Health?' Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and GP who sits on the Commons Health Select Committee, said: There's no doubt that sharing records is good for patient care. But ultimately patients own their medical records and they should decide who they share them with. Tory MP and former shadow home secretary David Davis said: 'It's an enormous threat to privacy.' 'There are some people who might want to access it, not for the best reasons, for example insurance companies.' There is concern that officials will use the data to make cuts to NHS services where they aren't deemed to be needed – such as diabetes clinics in areas where the disease is less common. Campaigners say drug firms could even use the data to raise premiums for at-risk groups. Ross Anderson, who specialises in information security at Cambridge University, accused Health Service officials of deliberate deception. He said: 'The NHS takes the view that it's our information, we'll do with it what we want. There is no effort to maintain patients' privacy.' The professor said it would be very easy for researchers, drugs firms or insurers to identify patients just by knowing their postcode and date of birth alone. Ultimately, he said it could lead to highly personal information about patients' illnesses or conditions appearing on the internet or in research papers. Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential, said the scheme was cynical and irresponsible. But Dr Geraint Lewis, who is chief data officer at NHS England, said: 'The NHS has been collecting information like this from hospitals for decades but until now we've been missing information about the quality of care provided outside hospital. 'This is about upgrading our information systems to get a more complete picture of the quality of care being delivered across all parts of the NHS and social care.' Dr Martin Scurr warned the database will 'be a honeypot for hackers' Ever since the launch of the NHS in 1948, patients have been able to rely on a principle of confidentiality – they have always been assured that their medical notes  are private. But now, for the first time, we GPs are being told to pass those notes to a third party. The records will be mined for data by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, but in future that could be passed on to researchers and even drugs firms with commercial profits in mind. We are told that all personal data will be in an ‘anonymous' form. But it will include your postcode and your NHS number. Hardly very anonymous, then. You can't tell me that this is not a breach of confidentiality. If the situation was different and a GP handed over this kind of information to a third party, and the patient found out and complained, the consequences would be severe. That complaint would be taken to the General Medical Council, and the first thing it would do would be to suspend the GP pending an investigation for a breach of professional ethics. Yet apparently it's quite all right for a government body to do this. This is really important and the public need to know about it. From today NHS England – which runs the health service – begins posting leaflets through doors explaining how and why this data is being used. Leaflets are all well and good, but what will people do with those leaflets? Some will simply bin them, mistaking them for junk mail. Doubtless there will be patients who wouldn't want their data released  but simply won't know that it is happening. If you tell your GP that you want to opt out, your details will not be released. But why should the Government decide to release this private information unless you actively take steps to stop it? Surely it should be the other way round – that people should opt in. To say that this is the thin end of the wedge is an understatement. Who's to say that confidential information you give to your GP might not be used against you in terms of health insurance? As David Davis MP rightly says, it will also be a honeypot for hackers. There may be benefits that come from researchers being able to look at this data, but we have no reason to trust the Government on this. After all, it has a particularly poor reputation when it comes to dealing with IT systems, and it is perfectly possible this data could be abused – at cataclysmic cost to the patient.","From spring, officials will begin building a giant database .

"The BBC was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss Rona Fairhead to resign over her £10,000-a-day second job at scandal-hit HSBC bank. It’s a new blow to Mrs Fairhead, chairman of the BBC Trust and a non-executive director of HSBC, who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high-profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest. She is due to be questioned by MPs tomorrow after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was paid £513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year, vastly exceeding her £110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the BBC. Last month HSBC came under fire over allegations that its Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of British taxes, and that it sought to influence media coverage. Silenced: Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon (right) who said Rona Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust, will not be shown . Now an HSBC shareholder has claimed the BBC refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that Mrs Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the Trust. Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon says he was invited to Broadcasting House in Central London to discuss the turmoil at HSBC in an on-the-record interview with a BBC business reporter on February 23. His interview failed to feature in the broadcaster’s coverage of the HSBC story that evening. He believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning Mrs Fairhead’s fitness to run the Trust. He said: ‘I said during the interview I disagreed with her appointment as BBC Trust chairwoman. ‘I couldn’t understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving HSBC. ‘It’s my personal belief she’s not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust. The HSBC item was shown, but my interview was not in it. I believe it may have been suppressed.’ Mr Mason-Mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against BBC policy. Mr Mason-Mahon is well-known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies. Last May he brought a lawsuit against HSBC’s North American arm after it was fined £1.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing Mexican drug cartels to launder money. Last week former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland called on Mrs Fairhead either to give up her post at HSBC or to resign from the Trust. Tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an HSBC Board member in front of the Commons public accounts committee, which has fiercely attacked tax-dodging corporations. Last night the BBC declined to say why the interview with Mr Mason-Mahon was not broadcast and whether or not Mrs Fairhead – who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions – was told about it. A spokesman pointed out that it was the BBC’s Panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about HSBC’s Swiss banking arm and added: ‘Like every news organisation we don’t use every interview we conduct. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the BBC.’","Called for Rona Fairhead to resign over £10,000-a-day second job .

"Jon Huntsman couldn't help but fire a parting shot at his Republican rivals, even as he withdrew from the presidential race and backed front-runner Mitt Romney Monday morning. 'This race has degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks not worthy of the American people and not worthy of this critical time,' he said during an announcement in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Huntsman, a former Utah governor and the President Obama's ambassador to China, must now navigate the tricky waters of supporting a candidate he slammed as an unelectable, untrustworthy flip-flopper. Shortly after Huntsman told his staff . Sunday night he was planning to quit the presidential race, videos and . statements criticizing the former Massachusetts governor disappeared . from Huntsman's campaign website. Family affair: Four of Jon Huntsman's daughters, including his adopted Chinese daughter Gracie Mei, stood on stage with him and his wife Mary Kaye (in the purple) today . Exit: Jon Huntsman leaves the stage after his announcement this morning, flanked by his daughter Mary Anne (left) and his wife Mary Kaye (right) Bowing out: Huntsman's presidential bid never gained traction and floundered after a disappointing performance in New Hampshire . As an opponent, Huntsman was one of Romney's harshest critics, offering several devastating assessments of the front-runner in an attempt to win over Romney's moderate supporters. 'I will always put my country first. It . seems that Gov Romney believes in putting politics first. Gov Romney . enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs. It may be that he’s . slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America . right now, and that’s a dangerous place to be,' he told reporters right . before the New Hampshire primary. Lest anyone forget Huntsman's harsh words, the Democratic National Committee produced a greatest hits list of the most cutting remarks by the former candidate. Big gains: Hours after the announcement, Mitt Romney thanked Huntsman for his support and praised his campaign . Plea for unity: Flanked by his family, Huntsman criticized the divisive tone of the Republican race and said the party needs to unite . And Huntsman's endorsement of Romney was no ringing embrace. Instead, he simply cited Romney's electability. Jon Huntsman's campaign pulled down statements critical of Mitt Romney as he moved to endorse the Republican front-runner. However, the Democratic National Committee won't let Huntsman forget what he said. It has released a list of his greatest Mitt-hits: . 'I believe it is now time for our party . to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences I believe that candidate is Gov Mitt Romney,' Huntsman said at a news conference with his wife and children. Huntsman staked his presidential bid . on making a name for himself in last week's New Hampshire primary. But . his candidacy never really gained traction and he came in a . disappointing third place behind Romney and Texas Rep Ron Paul. Campaign sources said Huntsman was dropping out now because he didn't want to pull support away from Romney, which could prolong the GOP presidential primary. Romney gladly accepted the affirmation from his fellow Mormon. 'I salute Jon Huntsman & his wife Mary Kaye. He ran a campaign based on unity not division, & love of country. I appreciate his support,' the candidate Tweeted moments after the public announcement. Despite his low support from voters, Huntsman's departure will surely be a boon to Romney. He was only polling at three to five percent in South Carolina and Florida, the next two primary states, but he was the only candidate still competing for moderate voters who are the backbone of Romney's support. According to recent polls, nearly all of Huntsman's supporters said Romney was their second choice. This further consolidates the establishment wing of the Republican party. Conservative voters are still divided between former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and, to a lesser extent, Texas Gov Rick Perry. Huntsman is the third candidate to leave . the race. Former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty exited in August and . Minnesota Rep Michele Bachmann dropped out after a poor showing in the . Iowa caucus. By his side: Huntsman made the announcement in South Carolina with his family, including his wife Mary Kaye . Waving farewell: Huntsman said he was ending his presidential bid because he believes Romney is the best choice to beat President Obama . Despite strong credentials -- an attractive, highly-educated former governor and businessman who speaks Mandarin Chinese and has extensive foreign policy experience -- Huntsman never rose above single digits in national polls. He staked his campaign on a victory, or at least a strong showing, in moderate New Hampshire. But the granite state didn't show him the love he was hoping for. He received just 17 percent of the vote compared to Mitt Romney's dominant 39 percent. Ron Paul came in second with 23 percent. New Jersey Gov Chris Christie turned down a Republican movement urging him to run for president this year, but he hasn't ruled out the possibility in the future. He told Oprah Winfrey during her visit to his home in Mendham, New Jersey, that he was considering running in 2016. 'I'll be much more ready for it four years from now than I am now,' he said. Christie says he can see his family occupying the White House in the future. The 49-year-old former US Attorney told Oprah he and his wife seriously considered the calls to run for president against Barack Obama, but ultimately he felt comfortable turning them down. 'Inside me it never felt right. I knew that if it didn't feel right, I couldn't be me,' he said.","Huntsman slammed the Republican candidates for a race that 'degenerated into an onslaught of negative and personal attacks'

"He claimed there were few vessels to enforce new regulations for UK inshore fishing waters after it leaves the EU.
And the ex-Falklands veteran, who was once a Labour security minister, said he was ""stunned"" at the government's ""amazing complacency"" over the issue.
But minister Lord Gardiner insisted a vessel monitoring system was in place.
Lord West raised the issue just days after the government announced it is to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention - the deal which allows foreign fisherman access to British waters.
Lord Gardiner, a rural affairs minister, said the Marine Management Organisation would supervise the UK's ""exclusive economic zone"", which stretches from six to 200 nautical miles - while the Association of Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities would cover up to six nautical miles.
But he added that as the UK leaves the EU a review will be needed to reflect on the level of fisheries enforcement required.
That response prompted Lord West to say: ""This simple sailor is absolutely stunned by the answer, which shows amazing complacency.
""The bottom line is we have very, very few vessels involved in this. They are not properly centrally coordinated. We've already seen a number of the countries involved saying 'well to hell with what you're saying, we're coming there anyway'.
""We will be made a laughing stock if we apply some rules and cannot enforce them.""
Lord West urged ministers to establish ""a centralised command system to actually control the various assets we have"", adding that ""far too few of them seem to be able to focus on things like someone fishing illegally in the six to 12 mile zones"".
He said more ships and boats needed to be built ""to ensure we can actually enforce it"".
The minister said he would like Lord West, who served in the Royal Navy between 1965 and 2006, to go with him to Newcastle to see a new digital vessel monitoring system that can pinpoint ""every vessel that's at sea within our waters"".
He said there were three offshore patrol vessels in operation, with a further five new river offshore patrol vessels being built that will be used for fisheries protection.
But Labour's rural affairs spokeswoman Baroness Jones of Whitchurch argued that ""fish stocks can't be managed unilaterally"", adding ""there has to be some cooperation with neighbouring countries"".
""Fish shoals can sometimes move for hundreds of miles, and indeed our own fishermen fish up to the north of Russia and southern Portugal,"" she said.
""There's no point in making a unilateral declaration.""
But Lord Gardiner said not only would the government be negotiating ""with our partners and friends in Europe so we have a sustainable fishing industry"" but post-Brexit the UK will ""have the ability to decide who fishes in our waters"".
He said the chief executive of National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations had welcomed the UK's decision to give notice to the London Fisheries Convention as ""an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone"".
He said fishing is worth Â£1.3bn to the UK economy, employs 34,600 people, has 6,000 fishing vessels and lands 708 tonnes of fish each year worth Â£775m.
The government would be ""very conscious"" of the interests of the coastal and fishing communities of the UK, he added.","The UK will be a ""laughing stock"" in Europe if it cannot police its fishing waters after Brexit, former First Sea Lord Admiral Lord West has said."
"Justin Welby made the announcement after a meeting of primates from the Anglican Communion in Canterbury.
In the UK, an act of Parliament passed in 1928 allowed for Easter Sunday to be fixed on the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April.
However, this has never been activated and Easter has remained variable, determined by the moon's cycle.
Easter is the most important Christian festival, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ following his death by crucifixion on Good Friday.
The archbishop said he was in talks with Pope Francis, Coptic leader Pope Tawadros, and the leader of the Orthodox church Patriarch Bartholomew.
Mr Welby said he hoped the change would happen ""in between five and 10 years time"".
""I would love to see it before I retired"", he said, although he warned the first attempt to make such a change was in the 10th Century.
An Anglican source told the BBC there had been 15 attempts to agree a common date since then.
Easter is on the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon following the spring equinox, meaning it can be celebrated on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April.
But the Orthodox church follows the Julian calendar, hence has later Easter celebrations compared with those of Western Christianity.
In 1990, the Vatican approved a proposal for a fixed date, which was subject to agreement with other Christian churches and governments. It has not yet been reached.",The Archbishop of Canterbury is working with other Christian churches to agree on a fixed date for Easter.
"It carries out a monthly survey of firms that tracks indicators such as new orders, employment and exports.
The latest report for April suggested a modest deterioration in business conditions, as output and new orders declined following growth in March.
That was the fourth monthly decline in activity in the last five months.
Ulster Bank's chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said Northern Ireland's modest decline in private sector activity compares with growth in all of the other UK regions.
Manufacturing continued to be a bright spot, with output growth and new orders rebounding to a 6-month high, driven by market demand in Great Britain.
By contrast, Northern Ireland retailers reported their sharpest decline in retail sales since May 2012 and the construction sector posted its largest fall in business activity in two years.
Mr Ramsey said that despite the apparent weakness suggested by the results, companies are continuing to hire staff.
""Despite uncertainty and lack of demand, local firms saw their staffing levels rise in April at the fastest rate in seven months. Employment growth was reported across all sectors with the exception of construction,"" he added.
Looking forward, he said that the detail of the new Conservative government's fiscal plans and economic policies ""will affect all sectors of the economy both public and private"".","The recovery in Northern Ireland's private sector has been ""effectively stalled"" since November, research by the Ulster Bank has suggested."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green. The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this. Sydney-based technology company Solar Sailor is working on a ""solar sail"" which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels. Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet. Some of the ocean-going beasts like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's ""Dubai,"" the biggest private super-yacht in the world, are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars, movie theaters, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools. All of these features sap incredible amounts of energy. Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power. • See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts . Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. He said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats' fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. ""We think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint, which is the big problem with these vessels,"" he said. Dane said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail, pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind. The ""sails"" are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection. A design project is currently underway in the United Kingdom to create a solar sail for the super-yachts, he said. Dane said the company was working with Chinese shipping company COSCO to get solar sails on some of its fleet. ""Our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010. Based on the results of this, then we would design 'new-build' vessels,"" he said. Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots. ""This might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey,"" Dane said. He said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently.","Solar sails are large solar-paneled wings which can harness sun or wind power .

"Washington (CNN) -- Within hours of President Barack Obama's announcement that Osama bin Laden had been killed, politics entered the fray. A small but vocal group of Republicans including former Bush administration officials began claiming that information obtained from waterboarding and other now-prohibited enhanced interrogation techniques led to the successful assault on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. Debate rages about role of torture . Interviews and commentaries by conservatives, including former Vice President Dick Cheney repeated the contention, citing media reports rather than direct information. A closer look shows no obvious evidence of a direct connection, at least to waterboarding, the simulated drowning technique considered to be torture under international law. While administration officials, former interrogators and others concede that thousands of pieces of information collected over the past nine years eventually brought U.S. Navy SEALs to bin Laden, no one has cited specific information that came from the harsh interrogations labeled torture. That doesn't stop defenders of enhanced interrogations from trying. Republican Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said that waterboarding alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to eventually provide information on the al Qaeda courier killed with bin Laden in the raid. Was bin Laden's killing legal? Mohammed was captured in 2003, and another high-value suspect, Abu Faraj al Libi, was captured in 2005. ""I think it's fair to say that it's a long way to getting bin Laden, but the first step along that road began with the intense interrogation"" of Mohammed and al Libi, King said. However, as CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger reported Wednesday, Central Intelligence Agency operatives already knew the courier's nickname when they interrogated Mohammed and al Libi. According to Borger's report, the detainee who initially provided the courier's nickname may have been subjected to harsh interrogation, but not waterboarding. Later, Mohammed lied to his interrogators about the courier, who was described as his protege, and intelligence personnel concluded that the courier was important because Mohammed was trying to cover for him, a senior U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence eventually uncovered the courier's identity four years ago ""from a different part of the world,"" the senior U.S. official said. Trail to bin Laden started with courier . King argued that Mohammed only talked after being waterboarded, and even though he lied about the courier, the fact he talked at all showed the value of waterboarding. To Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough, no such connection exists. ""This whole idea about somehow whether EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) played into that, I think, is just not consistent with the facts, and, also, a little bit of a sideshow, as far as I'm concerned,"" McDonough said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that locating bin Laden required years of painstaking work that eventually led to discovery of the address of the Pakistan compound last August. ""I can say with certainty that no single piece of information, with the exception of the address of the compound, was ... singularly vital to this, because we're talking about tiny bits of information that were compiled by unbelievably competent professionals over nine and a half years,"" Carney said. ""And it's impossible to know if one piece of information came from one source and was corroborated in another way; if, you know which thread held the cloth together, with the exception of the location of the compound."" Carney acknowledged that some information came from terrorism detainees, which he called one of many ways that information was gathered. ""Now, I can't categorically rule out that one piece of information"" played a key role, ""because we don't know,"" Carney said. Mark Fallon, a former interrogator at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, terrorist detention facility, rejected claims that enhanced interrogation techniques led to bin Laden's capture. ""I think some people are trying to rewrite history here,"" Fallon told MSNBC, adding that he was privy to information from Mohammed and wasn't aware ""of any substantive information or intelligence that was a derivative product of waterboarding."" One of Obama's first acts as president was to halt waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques of the Bush administration. The issue was one of the most contentious of the Bush presidency, with critics accusing the administration of legalizing torture while supporters called the enhanced interrogations necessary for combating terrorism. Now, those who were under fire for the interrogation policies are claiming vindication and calling for their return. John Yoo, a Bush administration lawyer who wrote the memo justifying the enhanced techniques, said in a posting Monday on the National Review website that the policy had worked. However, his posting only cited media reports based on anonymous sources, rather than any specific information gleaned from interrogated detainees. Marc Thiessen, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, made similar assertions on the group's website, but began his commentary by attributing his information to news reports. Cheney, interviewed on ABC and Fox, said he assumed enhanced interrogation techniques played a role in bin Laden's demise, but added he had no proof. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that information was key to the fight against terrorism. ""Now let's remember that in the early days, we knew very little about how al Qaeda operated and the roundup of their field generals like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed led us not just to learn that there was a courier -- I remember when they learned there was a courier who might be a link to Osama bin Laden -- but we also learned from those people about the structure of al Qaeda,"" Rice said. However, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she was unaware of any information eventually leading to bin Laden's location that ""came as a result of harsh interrogation practices."" Two conservative senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- also rejected the claim that waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation played a role in finding bin Laden. ""This idea -- we caught Bin Laden because of waterboarding -- I think is a misstatement,"" Graham said, citing instead the years of difficult intelligence work. ""I do not believe this is a time to celebrate waterboarding. I believe this is a time to celebrate hard work."" CNN's Gloria Borger contributed to this story.","Conservatives say Bush-era policies are vindicated .
Democrats reject that any valuable intel came from waterboarding .
The White House emphasizes years of tracking down countless leads ."
"The party won 10 seats, but the Conservatives have retained control with 45 out of 78 councillors.
The Tories had 51 seats before Thursday's vote, while the Liberal Democrats slipped from 24 to 17.
Labour's seats increased from one to four, while two independent councillors were also elected.
Former cabinet minister Mr Huhne, a Lib Dem, was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice, and his party lost both Eastleigh council seats to UKIP.
One of UKIP's gains was in South Waterside where Philip Fawkes, a distant relative of Guy Fawkes, was elected.
A 15th Century ancestor of the retired head teacher was the great-great-grandfather of the the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot ringleader.

It's been an historic night in the local elections - with UKIP winning its first seats on county councils in the south.
As soon as the votes came tumbling out of the ballot boxes in Hampshire it became clear that it was going to be a tough night for the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
Labour gained three seats - but it was UKIP's supporters who had the biggest smiles. They started the night with no seats on the county council - but they ended up with 10.
Across Hampshire, there were losses for the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives - but the Tories retain control of the county council.
One senior Conservative MP says the UKIP surge should prompt the prime minister to deliver stronger policies on immigration and Europe.
Conservative Alexis McEvoy criticised her own party's national leadership after losing her South Waterside seat to Mr Fawkes.
She said Tory leaders ""choose not to listen to what the public are saying"", which boosted the UKIP vote.
""I hope the government will listen because they never do,"" she added.
""They're arrogant, out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost.""
Andy Moore, 53, who won Eastleigh East for UKIP, said: ""We have told the truth. We have listened to the public who have put us in these positions as councillors.""
Martin Lyon, 47, who took nearby Bishopstoke and Fair Oak for UKIP, added: ""I'm just shell shocked.
""It's all about the people on the ground. There have been a lot of people who have put the work in over five to 10 years in Eastleigh.""
Lib Dem Sandra Gidley, who lost to Conservative Roy Perry in Romsey Extra, said she was disappointed but her stronger feeling was one of concern about the gains made by UKIP.
""It's a protest vote, it's a dangerous one; nobody knows what that party stands for,"" she said.
""It's now down to all politicians to try and reconnect with the public because what was clear to me is that the public have lost faith in all of us from all parties; that's why UKIP did well, not because they have anything to offer.""
Voting was also held on the Isle of Wight on Thursday and counting began at 09:00 BST.",UKIP has won its first ever seats on Hampshire County Council - including two in disgraced former MP Chris Huhne's town of Eastleigh.
